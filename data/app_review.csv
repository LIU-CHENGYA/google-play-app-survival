com.logicappkids,pathetic i went through 10 mi initial set justo endup to know that it's nota free app
com.logicappkids,its learninig app and sooo usefull
com.logicappkids,Nice
com.logicappkids,nice
com.logicappkids,"I uninstalled the app because you need to pay for some coloring pics. but in my surprise they auto-deduct something in my gcash that I don't authories. they deduct 1,150 pesos in my gcash acct and I really needed that money . it's so frustrating I hope you gave me back my money . 1150 pesos is so much money to spend just for the app . 😭"
com.logicappkids,It's cool
com.logicappkids,good
com.logicappkids,I need my refund because I cancel my subscription but you deducted . please return the amount.
com.logicappkids,good game
com.logicappkids,why no girl only boys?
com.logicappkids,pretty lame how they'll get you to do all the setup and then ask for 50 bucks. they should really start with that. Edit. I understand that the app is likely good. but starting with the payment before doing the initial startup would be a far more honest approach at releasing an app. the 3 day trial requires the potential for the auto renewal of 50 dollars for 6 months which is ridiculous and arguably predatory.
com.logicappkids,gud
com.logicappkids,I mean we have to pay and I don't want to waste my money on this as a parent I give it two stars it's not worth wasting your money 💰
com.logicappkids,why do you need to pay 😡

com.logicappkids,so expensive
com.logicappkids,So good you have to try this game you improved my girls attitude
com.logicappkids,Just like a dream~*⁠.⁠✧°+
com.logicappkids,why don't you put it free app. some parents that have kids with special needs need this free . I'd frustrates me ..
com.logicappkids,please approved my request of refund my child accidentally subscribe to the app the is supposed to pay for the bills please reconsider this request.
com.logicappkids,expensive app
com.logicappkids,I subscribed to 3 day trial and canceled the trial on first day of trial still after 3 days they deducted 3100 from.my account. Fraud app.
com.logicappkids,good for my brain
com.logicappkids,good
com.logicappkids,"waste of time, asks a million questions and then wants you to pay or enter a trial.. just make the trial free without strings"
com.logicappkids,it's pretty good 👍
com.logicappkids,sir you didn't make good update cuz I am have internet connection After is not connected this game sucks

com.magoosh.flashcards.gre,very good
com.magoosh.flashcards.gre,"This application brims with diverse and recondite vocab. I was genuinely dumbfounded by many of the words. Although I myself possess a tapestry of arcane expressions, traversing this lexical landscape left me feeling unexpectedly cornered —realizing that I was unacquainted with nearly fifty percent of the words the application has to offer. That realization, far from discouraging me, filled me with admiration"

com.hellochinese,"I've used lots of language learning apps but this one is honestly the most enjoyable and useful one I've used so far, especially for what if offers for free. I don't have the financial budget for paying for language learning apps, but without premium it does still give a lot for a good, basic understanding. So I appreciate that."
com.speechling.speechling,98% of time the coach feedback is worthless and provides no information
com.speechling.speechling,Great!
com.speechling.speechling,Parece buena pero no sé porque después de cierto tiempo revisando algunas tarjetas se regresa todo a cero. Las tarjetas demoran mucho en cargar. Además he visto que han subido excesivamente el precio para la suscripción.

com.speechling.speechling,it's a good app to improve my pronunciation. I like it because it's free.
com.lin.duo.hd.french,"French LinDuo's Support Team is certainly one of the very best in taking note of user feedback, replying with respect and efficiency. Excellent app and support service!"
com.lin.duo.hd.french,"Good vocabulary builder. It doesn't teach language,only vocabulary. I would give it 5 stars but for one REALLY annoying trait: the written tests check spelling immediately when the last letter is entered, not giving me time to check first.My fat fingers often result in typos, so this is a big deal."
com.lin.duo.hd.french,I used to play this game however I lost my phone and just remembered this awesome game. How can I recover my old account I remember I need to type random numbers and not email and password. There's no google auto connect?
com.lin.duo.hd.french,I been looking for a app just like this thank you for your work

com.lin.duo.hd.french,This is a great way to learn my French

com.lin.duo.hd.french,Very good language learning app
com.lin.duo.hd.french,"The best vocabulary trainer on the Play Store, for the least amount of money. After paying the monthly subscription fees for Duolingo and Memrise for years, I stumbled across this app and was finally able to drop those subscription fees and pay one lifetime fee. Over 2,000 words is quite a good amount, as these words are the majority of words one might run across in everyday life."

com.atistudios.ispeak.fr,"It's probably the best on the market but I work in an engineering sector and a section for technical terms would be helpful. I am somewhere between beginner and intermediate, I selected intermediate to increase my vocabulary but a section only for verbs and conjugations would be helpful. I'm hopeful this will be in the intermediate section. I gave it 5 stars because it is very user friendly and used along with other learning aids such as books, it has contributed to my Spanish."

com.moymer.falou,"​I think this is a great app ,you should download it"
com.moymer.falou,awesome app to learn a language by practical training and guided practise.
com.moymer.falou,The best 😁👍
com.moymer.falou,"I paid for the premium version and now a few days in the app doesn't even open, seems like there are others who have complained about similar issues. I chose to work around the existing bugs but the app not going past the initial logo is not acceptable, please fix this issue."
com.moymer.falou,"the app is AMAZING (it doesn't just show you words but it explains to you how to use them) but every single minute there's an ad showing up, sometimes even in the middle of an activity making it sooo hard to pay attention..."
com.moymer.falou,so helpful. makes you practice the words
com.moymer.falou,it's very good for my French project with my friend ty for helping me!
com.moymer.falou,Too much ads! even while studying a lesson then suddenly appears an ad IN THE MIDDLE OF A LESSON!
com.moymer.falou,its kinda making me speak the words instead of actually learning them but still a great app.
com.moymer.falou,nice
com.moymer.falou,awesome
com.moymer.falou,helps alot
com.moymer.falou,super helpful app to kick start a fun way of learning languages! it reinforces learning by repetition
com.moymer.falou,perfect 👌
com.moymer.falou,nice app
com.moymer.falou,"I remeber what I learn now bcz of practice, it's not like other apps where I spend time, and can't remember anything"
com.moymer.falou,easy to follow
com.moymer.falou,"app cannot understand japanese speaking properly, if there are multiple words its only getting one word, and giving error"
com.moymer.falou,it's a nice learning app
com.moymer.falou,wonderfull app really good
com.moymer.falou,Nice app
com.moymer.falou,it's a good app to practice
com.moymer.falou,"Used it for 30mins, lessons are relatively easy in the beginning as it should be however you are bombarded with ads after every single one, 50% if them you cant skip and last 2mins. The speaking tasks are easy but most of the time when u say it right it says its wrong or comes up with a error so u have to start over again despite being right. the writing task isn't a writing task its done for you, no writing involved just pick the words that are said and on screen not even other words there"
com.moymer.falou,wonderfull
com.moymer.falou,I like the conversational and writing parts.
com.moymer.falou,that was a stunning teaching and amazing app. I like it very much. keep it up.
com.moymer.falou,good
com.moymer.falou,some of Japanese word I speak can't be detected
com.moymer.falou,Good
com.moymer.falou,"I just got it, I chose my native language cuz I struggle to write in but I see that some of the things your app is teaching makes zero sense in grammatical terms and also some words are miss translated"
org.pbskids.gamesapp,not working
org.pbskids.gamesapp,Bring back the ability to download. Otherwise useless for parents that refuse to give their kids connected devices.
org.pbskids.gamesapp,very recommended!
org.pbskids.gamesapp,I like the game but can you make more games i don't like playing the same games
org.pbskids.gamesapp,idk if it has ads but it's fun!
org.pbskids.gamesapp,This Game Is 999% Fun!!
org.pbskids.gamesapp,"Used to love the app before they changed it. Prior to the recent update, it had a list of all the games and I could download certain ones for my son to use offline. I do not leave my son's tablet with network access, everything is offline. This latest update, that isn't possible anymore. Only 3 offline apps appear and he can no longer play the dozens of other games he used to have available when offline, because there isn't a download option. I don't understand why they would change this!!"
org.pbskids.gamesapp,no new games
org.pbskids.gamesapp,We love that the kids can play games but also learn a little. They are amazing kid games.
org.pbskids.gamesapp,"it was pretty good, but it got rid of a bunch of things"
org.pbskids.gamesapp,Te amo ♥️/♥️
org.pbskids.gamesapp,it's good 👍 😀😀😀😀
org.pbskids.gamesapp,Please bring back eeko house please and thank you
org.pbskids.gamesapp,I love it so much.
org.pbskids.gamesapp,"The 2026 update removed offline play for most games. That not only makes the app useless when out and about, but also really hard to navigate since there is no other way to save favorites. Which is super sad because this app has dozens of fun and educational games that my kids love. I'd be happy to pay for access to offline games again!"
org.pbskids.gamesapp,it wont even open
org.pbskids.gamesapp,Every time I try to play this game it keeps on crashing😡😤😮‍💨
org.pbskids.gamesapp,Version 6.0.1 ruined the app. You can no longer download games for you child to play offline. The app wants you online all the time now. Why 3-5 years need to be online. Next thing they will add in peer to peer play and try to turn this into Roblox 2.0. This was a great app with educational games you could put on a tablet with no internet to keep your kids safe. Now they want to control how and when your kids are on the internet. They also don't have patch notes any where. Uninstalled.
org.pbskids.gamesapp,games constantly freeze
org.pbskids.gamesapp,all my kids love this app.
org.pbskids.gamesapp,love ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖love ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕
org.pbskids.gamesapp,Its not working right on my tablet
org.pbskids.gamesapp,im 14 and I LOVE this app its amazing
org.pbskids.gamesapp,it didn't even let me on
org.pbskids.gamesapp,my son is learning new things and I love it.
org.pbskids.gamesapp,very good game for my kidos they enjoy playing the games and they actually are learning from it. they get to learn about words from word girl and learn about animals from wild crats.
org.pbskids.gamesapp,l love you
org.pbskids.gamesapp,"I use this app for my son, and it WAS good. but the new update is awful. games are harder to find since you have to scroll per show, and some games were removed altogether. there was a go kart game on here and I can no longer find it, it was his favorite! honestly awful update, bring the old version back!"
org.pbskids.gamesapp,"Changing it, because you used to be able to download games for on the go play, but it seems like they don't allow that anymore."
org.pbskids.gamesapp,it will help your own kids learn.
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,tellement cool
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,useless It provides more notification than help with to work.There was absolutely nothing of what I was studying in class so I couldn't work to revise You have to pay to have access to everything + the ad is fake
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,ça m'aide beaucoup pour les cours franchement incroyable je suis en 6ème et c'est de primaire à Université
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,"Practique cette application pour réviser des cours dans tout domaine de choix d'études, du primaire au supérieur. vraiment je recommande cette application. Nomad éducation vraiment top 👍"
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,"Application juste incroyable 😍 Je précise que je n’ai absolument pas été payé pour écrire cet avis, c’est 100 % honnête. J’ai acheté Nomad+ et je ne regrette pas du tout ! Grâce à l’IA, on peut générer des cours à partir des siens, créer des flashcards, des quiz, et tout ça rapidement et facilement. L’application est intuitive, efficace et fait gagner énormément de temps pour les révisions. Franchement, un indispensable pour les étudiants. Bravo à l’équipe 👏"
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,"Très sincèrement, je n'imaginais de loin pas que cette application allait être aussi complète. Il y a même une IA pour analyser et ré-expliquer les cours, c'est absolument formidable !"
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,Bien fait
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,"I've only just started using it and I absolutely love the Nomade Education app. It's teaching me and helping me; I highly recommend it, don't hesitate, just go for it!"

com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,"Franchement, Nomad Education, c’est incroyable. J’adore cette application parce qu’elle me permet de réviser partout et même à la dernière minute, ce qui est super pratique quand je suis en retard dans mes révisions. Il y a vraiment tout : des cours, des exercices, des fiches, des explications… tout ce qu’il faut pour se préparer efficacement. Même s’il existe une version payante qui limite un peu l’usage, l’application reste vraiment très bien et largement suffisante pour réviser correctement."
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,je vous donne 5 étoiles parce que vous avez osé nous aider à aller de l'avant. vous nous rapprochez de nos cahiers.
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,great 👍
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,j'adore ❤️
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,vous êtes incroyable mais pourquoi les programmes ne sont pas les mêmes à celle que l'on enseigne àl'ècole?
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,Everything has to be paid for...
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,This app is one of the best for anyone who wants to succeed in life. It’s very simple to use and offers an amazing learning experience. It has many useful features and keeps improving over time.
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,It's so good and not strong
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,"Cette application est vraiment bien pour les 3èmes qui veulent réviser pour pes évaluations ou le brevet,il y a tout les matières et sa aide biennnn 💕💕"
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,"c'est une super application pour réviser, rien à dire, seulement il y a trop de parties telles que les annales qui auraient pu être gratuites. Mais sinon il y a suffisamment d'exercices pour réviser."
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,I LOVE IT it rlly helped w my French exams I TOTALLY recommend it:D
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,TU apprends tellement de chose
com.nomadeducation.nomadeducation,c'est une application géniale
com.linguist,you can only learn 20 words for free. for me that was one lesson.
com.linguist,Beste app om talen te leren. Heb echt veel meer vooruitgang geboekt dan met andere apps in minder tijd.
com.linguist,Right app to get u on track
com.linguist,awesome!!!!
com.linguist,really good
com.linguist,very good
com.linguist,"Not sure how AI features warranty higher premium cost yet but since a discount was offered, decided to download. Very intuitive I for lexicon building and surprised Latin is offered as a language to study."
com.linguist,It was amazing 🤩
com.linguist,"The import feature often doesn't work, if it does work it will butcher page and writing formats so it's really difficult to read. the auto transcript generation is extremely unreliable. when importing YouTube videos it will make multiple lessons that cut off at random times. The app doesn't accurately track listening hours which is I will argue a majorly important feature. you have to fix your hours listened manually so you may aswell track outside the app. feels like a beta test but paid"
com.linguist,yeah it's a good app with so many things...... to get to start your language journey this is better.
com.linguist,"the best app that I never seen in my life, undiscreble app"
com.linguist,I tried this app and cancelled it before the trial ends. But the app still charged me for one year.
com.linguist,it is such an amazing app I can use it like for everything in Korean since I wanted to learn Korean I didn't know how to study and memorize words now I don't have to worry about learning a second language or a third language with this app. I will recommend it to everyone just download it and you'll see what I'm talking about it's perfect to learn something and it's mostly free so you can use it as you can.
com.linguist,"Excellent. LingQ provides an effective and intuitive platform for language learning, combining immersive content with structured lessons."
com.linguist,"recently became buggy, doesn't save words properly, or doubles the same words of which one half is saved, and other has to be saved??("
com.linguist,"es muy buena app, me ayuda a mejorar El escucha y ondirectamente El habla etc en Ingles pero es complicado por la rapido que va Al menos para mi que soy principiante y aun no me acosumbro pero voy mejorando 🛩️"
com.linguist,"The idea is great but it's not very good at what it does. The premium features like AI enhanced TTS don't even work properly, and beyond that it's just an overpriced text reader. You're better off looking for more professional apps."
com.linguist,it's great
com.linguist,"Voy 2 dias con ella y la verdad es que es buena, lo malo es que la mensualidad es algo cara, o almenos en mi pais"
com.linguist,"best reading app for japanese I have found so far. Being able to read, turn on/off furigana, get word and sentence translations without having to flip between resources is great. you naturally expose yourself to so much new vocabulary and can read at an appropriate level without it feeling like a grind. very happy so far."
com.linguist,This is the best app for learning languages. I have learned Spanish here. This app is top tier 🫶 ps: lately became buggy. If you fix it I'll fix the review
com.linguist,"I wish the app would show the words with their meaning in English, each time we listened to the lesson. It shows this when you listen for the first time only."
com.linguist,very usefull
com.linguist,excelente!
com.linguist,"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS SERVICE. they make it literally impossible to cancel your free trial. I signed up on the website they said you had to cancel through the website and not through the app, when I went through the website it was not showing me an option to cancel my free trial. This was the most frustrating experience I've had with canceling with canceling a free trial membership."
com.linguist,"I've always liked learning a language through reading, and this app makes this way very easy. I can instantly know the translation of an unknown word, or the whole sentece if needed. The app is integrated with several online dictionaries, including my favourite Reverso Context, so if the default translation does not fit the current context, you can see other meanings."
com.linguist,I really do like the app. I like the daily commitment I have to put to it not to lose my streak. I am able to learn new words every day. Thank you.
com.linguist,Very nice!
com.linguist,"Can't even log in because of my long password. Sends me a ""magic link"" which opens a web browser to an almost empty page, but doesn't open the app!!"
com.linguist,😃
com.selabs.speak,it actually helps me!
com.selabs.speak,Great app to use
com.selabs.speak,learning Italian with Speak. much better than Duolingo
com.selabs.speak,This is not like duolingo this makes you repeat it until you get it right.
com.selabs.speak,easy
com.selabs.speak,Good app. Easy to use.
com.selabs.speak,IT'S SO FUN
com.selabs.speak,It's so fun I would encourage anybody looking for an app to speak French or Japanese or Spanish I would recommendate this app it's so good because like whenever you're a beginner it says what you're going to say and then it gives you the chance to say it and if you say it wrong it will say it again and then you get to say again it's really really good I'd recommended it.
com.selabs.speak,videos buffer every 1-2 seconds making it almost impossible to watch.
com.selabs.speak,im on my 30th day of speak and I've learned more than I did in my 9 months of babble 🤷‍♀️
com.selabs.speak,very easy to learn this way . straightforward and to the point. I love the back and forth conversations
com.selabs.speak,Seems like a good app but no polish teaching
com.selabs.speak,WOW! An app that finally Rivals Duo Lingo. The ease to use if this app is amazing. And it allows youvto easily find the level of learning you would benefit most from. The designers of this app really did a great job. I've used a lot of apps that advertise speaking practice. This is the first that does it in a fluid way. If they could soften the interface so that it feels a bit more graphically appealing that would be great. 5 frikkin stars
com.selabs.speak,the app is friendly and helpful if I need to tighten up Spanish.
com.selabs.speak,my first time with situational learning this is a great feature 100/5 stars if i could
com.selabs.speak,helps out and doesn't rush it
com.selabs.speak,good so far
com.selabs.speak,영어 공부하기 좋은데 발음 기호를 읽기 힘드네요. rib을 rayd라고 읽으라고 표시하던데 라이드라고 읽으라는 건가요? 스피크가 만든 발음기호 말고 표준 발음 기호를 보여주면 좋겠습니다
com.selabs.speak,I love it
com.selabs.speak,對口說應用有很大幫助
com.selabs.speak,actually pretty good so far. this paired with Duolingo feels like a great way to learn a new language update: notice it gets hung up a lot in speaking portions. sometimes gotta restart that phrase because it isnt picking it up
com.selabs.speak,this app is awesome it helps me learn French better so when I go to college I will know what people are saying it would be awkward if I didn't know what to say that's why I speak is awesome for people who are learning because you can sing songs in French or in Korean or in any language you want to speak is an awesome app you should try it and maybe try French or Spanish whichever one you'd like this app is a five star because it's the most awesome app ever
com.selabs.speak,"I downloaded this app looking for something better than Duo lingo and got pretty much the same. My only problem is when I'm doing my speaking lessons, it catches my words every other time. For example I am trying to learn Korean. We are at the part when I'm asking if it's okay to do something. It will not register the first word, but will get the other and then when I put the two words together, it may or may not register. I stopped using it because of this. Tried again today, same issue."
com.selabs.speak,It's coo👍
com.selabs.speak,I didn't buy premium but I got charged 😡
com.selabs.speak,excellent. only issue is the fact I can't use it to learn german.😔 5/5
com.selabs.speak,absolutely amazing you need to try this app especially Spanish
com.selabs.speak,excellent help!!!!
com.selabs.speak,it is really helpful full and I am on it then just watching TV
com.selabs.speak,this is great im enjoying learning as i interact with A.I

This is for you! Enjoy stories written seemingly from the mind of a disturbed 10 year old? You're in the right place! Fan of stories where every character is a horrible human being? Like the feeling of disgust... of being in an ugly mood for the rest of your day? This app will give you that and worse!!! Re: 'Heir in Hiding'

com.mosalingua.entoeic,"it's an incredible app for consuming and learning vocabulary. I really recommend it. But I would like this app to give us an option to create a deck, or flaschard by category."
com.mosalingua.entoeic,I'll hf fin j down
com.mosalingua.entoeic,"It's a great app, it helps me to increase my vocab. I like it."
com.mosalingua.entoeic,Unfortunately I can't connect to my messenger account anymore since 1 year. So I can't use the app.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,The application helped me to learn French by increasing my vocabulary through their good methodology of repetion and now I can talk to anyone in french. It is the best application for anyone to learn language effectively. I love it.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,The app is very pratice. I really love it.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,Completly approuved. But I think we already have english bases to use it. Because all traduction is in english (maybe it is just my settings).. Thanks for all work you've done since a know you. The biggest improvement is due to your app coupled with english movies. Merci à vous
com.mosalingua.entoeic,the very best app to learn languages. would like to find arabic and hebrew later on in this app. it's such a good way of learning.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,"Great. But i don t understand, the app tell me I must change level, but it seem I can t, only 105 word on learning..."
com.mosalingua.entoeic,I've been lerning a lot
com.mosalingua.entoeic,Useful !
com.mosalingua.entoeic,easy to use
com.mosalingua.entoeic,Thank you for this app. Very useful for me I put 3 stars because I am disappointed concerning your business app which is not only in English like this app (for a total immersion)
com.mosalingua.entoeic,This app is easy to use and help you to have more vocabulary for the test toeic
com.mosalingua.entoeic,This is boon for me. I'm upgrading my English skills to Super Advanced Level.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,For me it's the best way to learn foreign (or just new) words using smartphone.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,I really enjoy using this app. Thank you
com.streema.simpleradio,really good app. what would make it better is a widget
com.streema.simpleradio,can't even listen to the stations I wanted to listen to.
com.streema.simpleradio,well done
com.streema.simpleradio,"a great,app !"
com.streema.simpleradio,"best radio app ruined by intrusive ads that steal control of the phone and cannot be closed. I'm sure it's against Android's market policies. I know that the developer will say that ads keep the app free, but all apps are supported by ads, yet they remain usable"
com.streema.simpleradio,"easy & simple, works well."
com.streema.simpleradio,nice 👍
com.streema.simpleradio,worst application. Only ads
com.streema.simpleradio,I am enjoying this app. Thanks very much.

com.streema.simpleradio,"Excellent app for listening radio and FM. After trying 100's of apps, I found this app is real."
com.streema.simpleradio,simply perfect
com.streema.simpleradio,"One of the strongest apps to hold signal for Radio 786 especially and The Voice Of The Cape Radio Station. Does have ads but I don't mind, because the Radio Signal doesn't disconnect for no apparent reason like the other Radio apps that I used for these Cape Town Radio 📻 Stations. Solid 💪 🫡 🏆 🥇."
com.streema.simpleradio,Make it accessible for Xiaomi Mi box. Anyway the best app for listening any radio worldwide. Recommend
com.streema.simpleradio,i hate ads but i will give this a try. 🌹🍁🌺🌿🌻☘️🌼🏵️💮💐🤔
com.streema.simpleradio,"The ads are constant and intrusive, to the point of making the stream skip. Nice, simple UI, but the ads are infuriating, and I'm not willing to pay for an app that annoys me this much on the free side. Uninstalling."
com.streema.simpleradio,I absolutely ❤️ simple radio. the variety is amazing. 👏 🤩
com.streema.simpleradio,advertisements published in every channel.
com.streema.simpleradio,I wish it had a thingie in the top bar of my phone when it was playing so I can pause or play

com.apple.android.music,Love Apple 🍎 Music 🎶 🎵 ❤️ 💯🔥 #JCole #DaveEast #KendrickLamar #Nas #Jay-Z #NickGrant #ChrisBrown
com.apple.android.music,The ui is a masterpiece itself.
com.apple.android.music,ดีดี
com.apple.android.music,This app is hard!!
com.apple.android.music,"Apple Music has been great overall, but there’s a persistent bug on Android that needs attention. When I upload custom images to my playlists, the artwork shows correctly inside the playlist, but the covers disappear on the main “Pinned Playlists” page. Re‑pinning, restarting, and reinstalling don’t fix it. This seems to be a thumbnail caching issue introduced in recent updates. Hoping the team can address this soon — it’s a small detail, but it affects the experience."
com.apple.android.music,fast and cool to use 😎 👌 😌
com.apple.android.music,"No way to block artists I don't like; suggest less seems to cause them to come up more often. Good music player, terrible streaming service. Playlists and radios sometimes randomly skip through many songs without input; and also often just randomly end, despite infinite playlist/auto suggest being active. This is an update from when I last tried it (I have recieved another free trial). The fixed issue has been removed from this updated review, but it still deserves only 1 star."
com.apple.android.music,way too buggy. gets stuck on a single playlist in your library with no way of getting to the top of the library menu without restarting app. nav is generally unintuitive.
com.apple.android.music,"Audio skips constantly while using Android Auto unless you clear the cash before you connect, every time, doesn't fix it if you try to clear cash while connected. I get this yeah free with my CC and it's so bad I'm going back to paying for tidal."
com.apple.android.music,The best app...
com.apple.android.music,"I have subscribed to Apple Music for years. Apple refuses to allow Apple IDs with security keys associated to login to Apple Music on Android or even via the web browser. Chrome on Android supports passkeys, hardware/USB keys, and NFC keys. My Apple ID is the only system I can't login to even using a passkey via my iPhone. There isn't a valid technical reason for this."

com.apple.android.music,Easy no drama
com.apple.android.music,"The sound quality is commendable. The visuals, though minimalistic, expounds origin and simplicity."
com.apple.android.music,Still pretty clunky compared to similar apps
com.apple.android.music,Worst Experience I have with this app
com.apple.android.music,no adds better than Spotify
com.apple.android.music,make floating window mode!
com.apple.android.music,wow
com.apple.android.music,"Worst experience ever. Apple Music subscription without clear confirmation automatically activated and money got deducted. This feels misleading and user-unfriendly. No proper refund option inside the app, no clear support guidance. Such dark-pattern subscriptions destroy user trust. Very disappointed. Will never recommend this app."
com.apple.android.music,"Muy mala, estoy escuchando música tranquila para dormir y de la nada me pone corridos tumbados (?) además su buscador es muy precario, no encuentra nada a no ser que escribas el título exacto, menos mal tengo los meses de prueba, no pagaría por esto."
com.apple.android.music,Nothing like Apple music.
com.apple.android.music,love it it's Weedboy Desinger visit my Music on Apple Don't Go away it's my favourite
com.apple.android.music,good
com.apple.android.music,Inferior in almost every way to the Spotify app. Almost as though Apple do not care about the experience of Android users.
com.chatexpo,It's good
com.chatexpo,it is a great app and u can choose which topic u wanna talk about. Love it!!
com.chatexpo,cool
com.chatexpo,"ok,so this app MAKES ME read Korean as a beginner and a first day! so I don't hate it just pls upgrade it for the person who did it and I just want to say the app is ok but it's not for me. others like it more and good job😊👍💕"
com.chatexpo,"I selected the beginner options and the first exercise it recommended was to read Japanese and respond to sentences. I got the app 'cause I don't know the language and it was expecting me to respond with words and phrases that the app didn't teach me. Also, include whether or not the app costs money upfront. Just because I invested the time of answering a few questions doesn't make me feel more obligated to spend money."
com.chatexpo,too buggy. didn't even get through the setup phase. needs work
com.chatexpo,Highly recommended
com.chatexpo,I think it's a fun
com.chatexpo,"I see one of the best set if features comparing to other similar apps. The problem is they all just don't work. You should not have brought such a crude product to the market imho. As for me, I'm not ready to pay for it."
com.chatexpo,не могу использовать свой микрофон не смотря на то что предоставил все разрешения
com.chatexpo,There was a bit or confusion with this app (I got charged a subscription but I didn't want it) easily got it sorted out and refund with their customer support. I might not want to use the app itself but their customer service is 10/10 good stuff. Highly recommend and. Thanks Ju!
com.chatexpo,its so helpful fun and i have learnt korean but it has strated to distrub first when i was using itt did not ask for money now it is asking for money and i used to chat for free what is going on ??
com.chatexpo,"Great app, need constant human improvement though. For the synonyms section suggestions are provided for the mother tongue, not for the target learning language. This is usually not very useful, I need suggestions on how to say that differently in the target language."
com.chatexpo,I don't like this boo
com.chatexpo,good
com.chatexpo,"the language that I want to learn isn't here, hope u add Thai in the future"
com.chatexpo,its the best 😁
com.chatexpo,The evaluation never loads. Stuck. sad.
com.chatexpo,nice
com.chatexpo,needs improvements
com.chatexpo,So happy to have found an AI application that supports Indonesian. It has all the features I want.
com.chatexpo,I don't know about this app but giving u 5 Stars
com.chatexpo,It's so good and useful for me. Thanks a lot..
com.chatexpo,For Japanese even if you say you are new and know nothing it expects you to know how to respond to sentences and read Japanese without teaching you anything first... am I missing something?..
com.chatexpo,its great
com.chatexpo,"I couldn't even register, a bunch of bugs..."
com.chatexpo,didn't work
com.chatexpo,"this app seems very good, actually, but you can't expect me to know all the kanji for the japanese course when even the locals have to look some of them up. Sadly the Japanese course is not possible like this, too bad! (there's over 50.000 kanji signs)"
com.chatexpo,nice app
com.chatexpo,the latest update has broken the app. Useless.
com.busuu.android.enc,Fantastic

com.busuu.android.enc,"seems better than the owl game, but the ad infrastructure is terrible if you don't pay. I can't even try long enough to see if id be willing to pay because of the ads. such potential, but a victim to the same garbage that let Google and Netflix ruin the Internet."
com.busuu.android.enc,thanks for this app
com.busuu.android.enc,"great for language learning, but a bit buggy on android"
com.busuu.android.enc,I decided to stop using the system last year as it was not suiting my learning style. Last week the company billed me for another year of use. I have now sent them a second message about a refund and so far nothing has come back. I am disappointed not to hear and I will update the feedback as an when they get in touch. A refund at this stage is not looking likely but I hope I am wrong
com.busuu.android.enc,Busuu is a great app for learning languages. 👍 👑 🏆
com.busuu.android.enc,I love this app!
com.busuu.android.enc,it's a good app just wish there was more speaking and listening lessons Less reading ones
com.busuu.android.enc,I love the lesson breakdown and the free version is great. it has a learning plan that actually helps you learn and not playing games and it's fun and puts you in real conversation mode. good job on this app
com.busuu.android.enc,Amazingly good
com.busuu.android.enc,perfecto
com.busuu.android.enc,busuu is very good
com.busuu.android.enc,very useful
com.busuu.android.enc,very awsome
com.busuu.android.enc,good for beginners that want to learn another language
com.busuu.android.enc,I was very dissapointed with this app because the Flash Card feature did not work properly. I felt I was ripped off.
com.busuu.android.enc,It's Not That Perfect I Think Because It Contains Unwanted Ads And It's Just A Waste Of Time If You Download It Thinking It's Completely Free.
com.busuu.android.enc,"I love this! it doesnt have hearts like duolingo that doesnt let you continue afterwards unless you have the points, which honestly is annoying. But Busuu let's me practice at my own pace without any hearts or anything. its actually better than Duolingo, I think Duolingo just has more ads for it than Busuu, that seems ti be the only reason why its more popular."
com.busuu.android.enc,"it's a great app to learn languages, but now busuu is showing ads not only at the end of every lesson but also at the beginning, it's so annoying."
com.busuu.android.enc,it's so good and the images makes it more relatable and able to concentrate
com.busuu.android.enc,worst app ever
com.busuu.android.enc,perfecto
com.busuu.android.enc,i like this app
com.busuu.android.enc,good so far
com.busuu.android.enc,"Absolutely great experience. Native speakers introduce the word/ topic, better than the 100% AI voice Duolingo uses. No energy system (Duolingo) and no limited timer until you can learn (Ling). Learn for free forever without an energy system, ads are also less compared to duo, not after every lesson but after only every 2 lessons. You can go to the community page in the app to get feedback from other people who speak the language natively for free! 10/10"
com.duolingo.literacy,"I like other other duolingo because I can learn Korean, but unlike this one, I can only learn English i hate it"

com.duolingo.literacy,this app helps me in school or education
com.duolingo.literacy,even though I am 7 I still like it but it is too easy
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"Amazing language learning app, much better than the likes of duolingo. Smart, engaging, and easy to use. My only complaint is that whilst the ai chatbots are a good use of ai, the ai generated images are incredibly unnecessary and are upsetting to see for such a well established app. Edit: Ai has detrimental effects to the environment and is funded by corrupt billionaires. Any form of usage of it causes mass water shortages, energy loss, and it steals to create. Ai is negative to every industry"
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,Level 1 beginner Italian. Went through a bunch of lessons. The phrases spoken by the app miss a letter or two at the start. Also still waiting for the app to ask me to speak.
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,why is everything pro
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,the best app for students to learn English
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,you get one free lesson before it makes you pay an insane amount of money. dont reccomemd. use duo lingo instead.
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"Mondly is useful for practice, but it often rejects translations that are actually correct, which can be frustrating and misleading for learners. For example in the Polish course: “Ja nie mogę kupić królika.” My answer: “I cannot buy a rabbit.” Mondly insisted on: “I cannot get a rabbit.” But “buy” is a fully correct and natural translation. The app often does not accept translations that are correct or even more accurate."
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,superb app to use
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"It's truly a wonderful and engaging application that presents a variety of interesting topics, which are practiced through pronunciation, writing, and images. I recommend it for learners up to the intermediate level."
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,False notifications!
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,The best app for learning a new language but it should first give you dictionary words instead of long sentences
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,terrible app absolutely useless for intermediate learners also it constantly suggests premium package stay away!
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,too much spam to get the paid subscription. please stop requesting it so often.
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,I like the app
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,really creative and great i just like that
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,needs Luxembourgish
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,this helped me pass Afrikaans as a proud black person not to be racist
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,good
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,I LOVE LANGUAGES AND FLAGS AND COUNTRY
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"You don't have the Serbian language as offer, Serbian and Croatioan are not the same, there are plenty off better app that offer all languages"
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,vary good
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,cannot create an account. doesn't allow me
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"it is very very useful and helpful I love it so much,although I would preference if the voice detection works better"
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"Out of all the Bulgarian apps I've come across, this app makes it fun and easy to use. Not only is it very informative, but it makes me want to learn Bulgarian even more."
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,Best Language Learning app ever
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"This app makes learning languages genuinely fun and effortless. The interactive design keeps you fully engaged and the lessons are structured in a way that helps new words stick naturally. I especially love the Speaking option, helps you practice speaking and improves pronunciation. The Words section gives u chance to review and provides also grammar. Nothing feels boring, it s perfect for anyone who wants to learn and remember a new language with ease."
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,My subscription was not activated even after payment. Support team is not responding to email's. Very bad experience.
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,AI pronunciation needs improvement. I wish they used native speakers to guarantee proper pronunciation. Lessons feel rushed without enough focus on vocabulary building. You are thrown into sentences too quickly without learning the words surrounding the nouns. It makes it difficult to retain the other parts of the sentence. The app would really benefit from a proper chat function. It should also include word 'history' telling you the root of the word and the ACTUAL translation of a sentence.
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"This is one very good language learning app! I'm learning German SUPER fast! I've been learning Spanish at school, but I just wanted to learn Spanish faster :3. For French, I am not really that good at learning it because they don't teach that at my school, but they do at my brother's school. I'm learning French and German for travel, but Spanish is just to improve my grade in school. I would recommend learning languages on this app because it's better than just learning languages at school"
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,good 👍

es.monkimun.lingokids,my son love this app he get on it everyday
es.monkimun.lingokids,It has all sorts of inappropriate content and there's no way to block it
es.monkimun.lingokids,it's good for grades
es.monkimun.lingokids,I paid for plus and can't use it
es.monkimun.lingokids,all of the learning stuff cost money only thing thats free is a couple games
es.monkimun.lingokids,doesn't work. tried to contact them but they didn't answer back 😞
es.monkimun.lingokids,buggy unresponsive games touch doesn't don't waste your money. I bought it for year subscription for my kid. app buggy doesn't work for most of time. totally disappointed
es.monkimun.lingokids,everything is lock I just want to unlock zootopia but that would happen why would kids buy stuff if kids asktheir parents the parents would no and the mother will say where the heck will I get money
es.monkimun.lingokids,game is not loading properly. also so many things are locked and we cant just buy the app you gotta pay for a membership for a whole mess of games that I dont even have.
es.monkimun.lingokids,I love it 😍😍😍💖
es.monkimun.lingokids,"hello, I thought this was an free game, but I can't even barely play anything. And I'm 10. Waste for storage if you don't have money for the ""Plus""."
es.monkimun.lingokids,pay to play of course and not even enough free ones to test out if my kid would really like the app enough to pay for it.
es.monkimun.lingokids,i only wanted to use the letter tracing part but im in a endless loop between putting in my birth year and it forcing me to buy a subscription even tho it isnt a locked game LOL no way my child will be able to use this app. other games of the sort offer more reasonable payment methods and better content. this appp isnt worth a monthly payment
es.monkimun.lingokids,له 🇴🇲💗😍❤️🥰🥳💘💖💝♥️ 6-7 درة
es.monkimun.lingokids,i love the game it is soooo fun
es.monkimun.lingokids,They will deduct your subscription automatically especially when you're sleeping I only use this app once but they deduct me a year subscription with no informing about it im very dissappointed with this app i want to refund my money take note i see the due date its on january 27 2026 but they deduct me in January 16 2026 at night so what is the meaning of that??

com.lms.greatlakes,Great Learning platform is a great learning platform. Highly interactive and easy to use.
com.lms.greatlakes,"teachers are good, cost is economic for courses for upskilling. Some fee is charged only for certificate which is good ."
com.lms.greatlakes,good
com.lms.greatlakes,"The app is awesome, BUT it Keeps crashing or glitches mostly. Hope it is fixed soon."
com.lms.greatlakes,"Neither the paltform, not the team is supportive. For about a month and quarter I am struggling to get a very simple documentation. Processes are similar to slow processing archiac organization."
com.lms.greatlakes,"This is one of the most scamming learning platform. It advertise of free courses. But when you enroll free courses it shows ""only the course content free, buy the certificate to showcase your skills $5""."
com.lms.greatlakes,It's a scam. They redirect you to the web for payment and then stop responding to queries.
com.lms.greatlakes,veru useful app
com.lms.greatlakes,Thank you for free course
com.lms.greatlakes,nice
com.lms.greatlakes,till 2024 there were free access to courses and certificate but now no free certificates even for free courses so disappointed...
com.lms.greatlakes,Very Good
com.lms.greatlakes,"I enrolled in a DSBA course. The course had pre-recorded videos, (very poor quality), one mentor took a weekly session , where the mentor was only reading ppt. After completion of the course I applied for many months through this shiit platform and got no interview call. Someone from this shiit platform called me asking about my current status, but unfortunately she also was selling me a Masters course in DSBA. I lost one year and 2 Lakhs. Please don't waste your time and money like me."
com.lms.greatlakes,this is 3rd class app saying the course are free but after completing the course they are not giving the certificate for the free as the course is for free
com.lms.greatlakes,Good app
com.lms.greatlakes,not working
com.lms.greatlakes,this say free course and certificate is costly
com.lms.greatlakes,great app to learn and acquire skills.
com.lms.greatlakes,"I have giving this rating my own. This rating is not requested by the great learning application. I am giving it but my experience. It is best forever. I will never forget it. It is such a very valuable application and it's courses offered by it. One thing of this application which makes it very fantastic is that it is totally free, remember this point. And also suggest to all of those whose backgraund os programming."

com.lms.greatlakes,App doesn't open 😒
com.lms.greatlakes,why are you not showing that it's paid certificate course why you showing in your portfolio that it's free and when I get download and complete my courses then you want money of 299 . If you want then you don't write it's free course ok. Cheap minded people.
com.lms.greatlakes,"I have completed the Introduction to Cybersecurity course, but after completing the quiz at the end, they ask me to pay 349 for the certificate. They don't give any information about paying for the certificate in the whole course or In the information detail brochure. This is very bad. So please keep in mind before pursuing any online course in this app that when you complete the free course, they will charge for the certificate"
com.lms.greatlakes,We need to pay money to get the certificate..

bc.leg,Nice ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
bc.leg,This app is more helpful to learn English grammar.
bc.leg,Good
bc.leg,I suggest this app for those who want to improve their skills in English literature. it's very good and the app also provide us with some questions to see if we are improving our English language.

bc.leg,"I always receive ad notifications to remove ads by in-app purchase but I already bought it. If I tab, it says I've already purchased. Please stop these annoying notifications! They come at least one time ever week. Don't any of you use this app yourselfes?"
bc.leg,You're so cruel. You make a good app. Then you include ads WITH VIDEOS. This makes the app too expensive to use for students. Do you understand that my students don't have jobs? They are students. They don't have spare money to spend on watching your silly video ads.
bc.leg,"The answer is ""Yes, I am."", My answer ""yes, i am"" but wrong"

com.sirius,"Re: Boy Band Channel. It needs to be updated with a greater variety of songs. The same songs circle around continuously on repeat. Even in less than a day's time you can sometimes hear the same cycle start again! There are new boy bands that could be added to the channel and additional songs. Midnight til Morning would be a great brand new edition. I only listen to two main stations, and this is one of them, and it's getting frustrating to where I'm switching over to other services"
com.sirius,app sucks finding my music
com.sirius,"11/22/22Horrible, TuneIn is times better and it's free, I'm on my second day of the 90 days free,it keeps dropping, and you have to stop what you're doing, go to the home page and start all over, because the mini menu disappears, it does this every 5 to 10 minutes. I for sure will not pay a dime for this app. 1/26/26. Please stop making me enter a code every time I open up my app I do not want to cancel my subscription but I will if I have to keep putting in a code every time I use my app!"
com.sirius,Great music variety 👌
com.sirius,AMAZING
com.sirius,"I really liked the app, but got tired of it opening up and playing music all on its own. Had to uninstall"
com.sirius,"since one of the latest updates, if another audio source plays, such as an ad in a game or on a website, it doesn't just pause siriusxm, it shuts it down so I have to reopen it to press play. in the past siriusxm would autoplay as soon as the Coulter audio source was gone"
com.sirius,someone else signed me up without my permission
com.sirius,"Terrible, you guys have a 7 billion a year operating budget and can't make an app that plays longer then 5-10 minutes. Do you mean the Sirius app ""autoplay setting""? If so that didn't do anything. It still says "" We are having trouble playing this""."
com.sirius,They enrolled me without my permission!
com.sirius,so much content!
com.sirius,The new update still didn't fix the scroll issue in andriod auto. The screen returns to the top before you can select a station beyond the first three. So the latest update fixed the scroll issue!! Now you can scroll to whatever you want.
com.sirius,I l9ve the channels and listen often in my car and at home
com.sirius,there's a couple things I like
com.sirius,doesn't work om Motorola to
com.sirius,use every morning to listen to howard stern on our daily ride commitment. absolutely recommend to all my fellow drivers
com.sirius,great app
com.sirius,The sleep channel is excellent if you have trouble sleeping through the night. I would recommend giving this channel a try.
com.sirius,"I hate the new interface. Please, please, please bring back a simple button that says favorites!"
com.sirius,love it
com.sirius,"This subscription works in my car, and it's supposed to work from the app on my phone, too. But it doesn't! I've tried over and over again to use it to play Christmas music while I'm in the house, but it glitches, shuts itself off, displays a message that it's having trouble playing my choice of music. Seriously? I reboot my phone to help, but then it just repeats the same song over and over each time it restarts. Not happy with Sirius!"
com.sirius,"Every time I get in my car and I hit my Bluetooth for my media. This app overrides everything, and I have to go in and pause it and close it out. And there are no options to turn that feature off. It's really starting to irritate me and i'm about to cancel my whole service just so I don't have to deal with fix your app.And bug problems at everybody is complaining about Sirius on the one people have been complaining.For years get with the program"
com.sirius,trying to add new car. can't find out how to do it.
com.sirius,"Anytime I have my phone, I have ALL News, Music and Sports at my fingertips."
com.sirius,It is great to hear Howard Stern in an unedited format
com.sirius,flickers horribly no matter which phone I try this app on.
com.sirius,Current version is much improved; earlier version repeatedly crashed. The app is stable and easy to navigate.
com.sirius,Good luck trying to get your favorite shows live. All I can find are yesterdaysshows and shows i dont listen to.
com.sirius,"I received a free 6 month trial with my phone carrier. Yesterday I get an email saying that in 30 days my trial would end and that if I didn't cancel, I would be charged. I immediately went to my account, manage subscription and cancelled. I don't even listen to Sirius XM. Not only did you ignore my cancellation, you charged me the following day, despite it being 29 days before my trial ended."
com.sirius,having problems on my Google Android 16 pixel10. it keeps stopping here and there and I tried to uninstall it and reinstall it. same issue. it does it occasionally! and this the only app that does that.

com.aimastery,very informative
com.lingodeer,To be honest I like this app Soo much easy interface and worked offline as well
com.lingodeer,so far it's actually nice I would like a more satisfying sound when you get it right and I would like some good background music according to what the user chooses I think that would be SICK!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🙏🔥🙏🔥🙏 AND GOD BLESS
com.lingodeer,love this app
com.lingodeer,good
com.lingodeer,great
com.lingodeer,very nice it also shows the meaning of the word how to pronounce it very nice app must try
com.lingodeer,Feels like the most efficient way to learn Japanese.
com.lingodeer,best for beginners to professionals...good for the Topik exam too.
com.lingodeer,"lingodeer is actually good for learning language especially Korean and it's more easy than Duolingo, now I can understand Korean well 💅🏻🌺"
com.lingodeer,nice
com.lingodeer,u can learn languages easily
com.lingodeer,"This app is perfect, I've had so much fun learning in it💗"
com.lingodeer,professional speaker are the worst they make mistakes and sometimes pronounce it incorrectly like(ずすじんでわ) which is (いぎりすじんでわ)
com.lingodeer,Have paid version. Learning pointless words that I'll never need repeated over and over and I can't get past. In the first lesson I learnt 'robot'. Prefer Duolingo. Only changed as seemed to have a better rating.
com.lingodeer,Would've give it 5/5 but the paywalls have spread like a disease. Next worse things to come will be tiers mark my words. Even the Lifetime subscription was removed.
com.lingodeer,"There are some nice features in this app but when the assignment is Write The Sentence ""I'm not Japanese"" but the choices are about being British or American then it isn't clear how to choose the right answer. As written in the app, some sentences don't make sense. I typed in one as the app presented it into a chat bot and it determined that it said, ""I am a spider"" but the app claimed it said, ""I like travelling""."
com.lingodeer,useless if you aren't rich enough to afford it
com.lingodeer,they even have native speakers for practice
com.lingodeer,I love this app. it is very easy to use and easy to learn
com.lingodeer,very impressive & I'm interested to learn japanese language
com.lingodeer,"Why do I have to pay for every lesson after the first one? NONE of the lessons for section 2 were available for free, meaning there was no possible way to continue with the app unless I paid."
com.lingodeer,Only been using the app for a week and have to say its great. I use it twice a day.
com.lingodeer,it is fun to learn with lingodeer its better than duolingo. I am learning japanese in this app it is super fun.........

com.relitygames.englishgrammar,"one of the best app to learn english. especially about english grammar. if you are a student or an aspirant, definately this app will help you a lot"
com.relitygames.englishgrammar,"Scoping out something to help students practice and learn on their own. The interface is clean and the app itself is to the point. However, if you've zero or low English comprehension the grammar explanations may be difficult--they're only offered in English. This app would be great if the interface language had options, or if the explanations had translations available. Changing my phone's language didn't seem to affect the app's display."
com.relitygames.englishgrammar,best app for beginner and understand each concept but this app limitation is there is no grammatical notes content includes @ I hope to improve this comment other time
com.relitygames.englishgrammar,"it was interesting 😁.... nd this app like this that I wanted now I'm so excited to doing... nd 1 level I completed right now ... this was so good so well. nd I got U 3 Stars that U deserved it... so I'm good 👍🏻.... genuinely appreciate your business.... nd it's my flattering ....! soo,? every student should need to try this!!!!

com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Simply superb app for absolute french beginners
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,i hate this app fix please
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Good for listening to fast french speaking and learning new words. However it definitely builds patience as there is so much lag.
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,You have to sign up to use it
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"The app lags a lot, especially when you are listening to the audios. It seems to take forever to respond and then responds at once altogether. It would make a great 5 star app if those issues were to be fixed."
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"Nice idea and all, but as soon as you start a section, it freezes on the screen. I'm sure it's not my phone because if I got out of the app, everything is working just fine."
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"You think you downloaded an app ready to use but when you open it all you have is a page to open an account with your email, that sucks 😞"
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Good
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"Working to slow on my device Redmi 9. But the idea for application is genius. Make the same app for German, please. I will buy subscription if you do."
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,It's pretty good. Though I would like to see the previous sentences thar I've gone through before.
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,i want to try but it seems buggy. After audio clip plays it freezes and i have to close the app. Unusable unfortunately
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Great app for building listening skills
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"I just discovered this app and I really like it. Easy to use, and focuses on listening to authentic French dialogue. So far, a very positive experience."
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Great app so far! Finally something that is not for beginners and expands your vocabulary.
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"Great concept, but the audio is terrible. It's a hard no for me."
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Audio quality over voice recordings are poor which hard for a beginner to figure out what was being said even if I did know the words.
com.funeasylearn.french6000,It does help with spelling and understanding the vocabulary sounds.
com.funeasylearn.french6000,جيد جدا للمبتدئين
com.funeasylearn.french6000,"Até o momento, muito bom!"
com.funeasylearn.french6000,magnifique
com.funeasylearn.french6000,"Forces you to sign up for a 7 day trial and then be charged $50 if you don't cancel, without even letting you see any of the course. Makes you answer a bunch of questions as if it is starting the course and then forces the 7 day trial. Asking Google to remove app from store and ban developer. Grade = F. Uninstalled."
com.funeasylearn.french6000,"low quality app, is not responsive. push you toward subscription and asking for your credit card"
com.funeasylearn.french6000,pretty good and easy for beginners I recommend it
com.funeasylearn.french6000,super
com.funeasylearn.french6000,"I'm really enjoying this app, it's simple steps to improve my very basic French, it's been many years since I studied the subject, I'm just refreshing my knowledge, I hope to visit Brittany early in the New Year and would like to grasp the basics."
com.funeasylearn.french6000,"Everything is good except the downloading. Please add the feature of pronouncing every word including the article, because it's feminin and masculin."
com.funeasylearn.french6000,it helped me learn faster than I expected
com.funeasylearn.french6000,وااتتتات اعطيني
com.funeasylearn.french6000,Excellent!
com.funeasylearn.french6000,this is much more easy to learn
com.funeasylearn.french6000,"The new art style is so ugly and boring! Reminds me of AI advertisements, the 3D artstyle. I liked the original art, it was unique. Now it looks like it was made with generative AI, like all those 3D mental health advertisements. Really worried that this art style will get added to the other languages. I've been avoiding updating the other languages since this horrible art style update on the French one."
com.funeasylearn.french6000,very good learning app with fun games nd no annoying adds .
com.funeasylearn.french6000,smooth!
com.funeasylearn.french6000,tested approved and trusted

com.funeasylearn.french6000,easy to learn from images and i love the fact that i tells you to replay what you've learnt in case you made a mistake the first time.
com.funeasylearn.french6000,very nice and interesting helps you from scratch
com.funeasylearn.french6000,it is amazing
com.funeasylearn.french6000,just started and I am enjoying it so far wanted 5 minutes a day but fine myself doing 15-20 minutes. it's entertaining
com.funeasylearn.french6000,😊😊😊
com.funeasylearn.french6000,"It has many ways of presenting the language, including hearing, reading, choosing, etc. The best thing for me is that I don't get stock on just wordings, It also has sentences. My preferred app so far!"
com.funeasylearn.french6000,lots of fun and a nice way to learn
com.funeasylearn.french6000,برای یادگیری لغات عالی است
com.funeasylearn.french6000,"I like it, although I do thing it would of been better if you can skip stages since I already know a little french but had to start from the beginning, other than that, great app!"
com.funeasylearn.french6000,una de las mejores que he probado vas a tu ritmo
com.funeasylearn.french6000,it didn't quite teach me French
com.amazon.mp3,"I can't count how many times I've bought music, and then it doesn't show up in my library. Or only some of the album populates or I have double entries of songs within an album. Then I have to go through several troubleshooting steps to get it to populate or I have to contact Amazon Music tech support."
com.amazon.mp3,good music
com.amazon.mp3,The audio quality of the music has been deliberately lowered to force customers to 'upgrade' to what it should have been to begin with. Lots of songs are either unavailable or can not be found. Forced subscriptions to family plans to multiple device streaming. Amazon Music is really taking the mick out if its' customers...
com.amazon.mp3,add free that's why great
com.amazon.mp3,worst app i ever seen in the world
com.amazon.mp3,Frustrating
com.amazon.mp3,best collection
com.amazon.mp3,Best music App
com.amazon.mp3,no hi res lossless audio support
com.amazon.mp3,amazing sound quality
com.amazon.mp3,"unable to download the music I want, unlike Spotify"
com.amazon.mp3,please improve quality
com.amazon.mp3,best feature is the podcast player - it remembers where im at correctly! plus is able to play in either ascending -OR- descending order from that spot in the middle of a back catalog I literally ONLY use $This $Here app to listen to podcast/z ~ specially Gary's Everything Everywhere Daily! now That's what I call a 6 outta 5 star pod! My fav music player (YT Prem) cannot even seem to do that 😅
com.amazon.mp3,Playback causes extreme battery drain
com.amazon.mp3,Spotify and Tidal connect are far better for use with streaming devices. Do better!
com.amazon.mp3,Variety is the key to enjoyment
com.amazon.mp3,awesome
com.amazon.mp3,An app full of glitches. Most of the times downloaded songs can be reversed inspite of asking to do the same. Sometimes the search is inaccurate etc etc.
com.amazon.mp3,"it's a good catalog but I would have thought that after paying prime this would be more on the ""unlimited side than it currently is."
com.amazon.mp3,MESSED UP TO HIGH HELL
com.amazon.mp3,Easy to use!!
com.amazon.mp3,interferes with the play list which is very annoying thank you
com.amazon.mp3,"Adds free music is really good. Lot of options to explore, that's great."
com.amazon.mp3,"thankfully, yours truly Kundani Ndou ♥️"
com.amazon.mp3,"I must have been spoiled by Apple Music. This app doesn't hold a candle, especially since they charge a buck more per month for an individual plan. Navigation sucks! Expected a lot more for a company like Amazon."
com.amazon.mp3,"ok, up to this point however music interrupted to request review"
com.amazon.mp3,"The Application won't let me use the repeat function, after I have downloaded the song several times!"
com.amazon.mp3,la aplicacion tarda demasiado en reporducir las canciones aun teniendo conexion buena de internet

org.khankids.android,"Some of the little hidden messages in the stories are a little crooked. Such as the story called Big Kids Don't Cry. I agree with the lesson. It is a truth that we all cry and shows a sister and friend being kind and caring. however, at the beginning of the story it shows a mom teaching that ""big kids don't cry"". and continues to explain how the main character always try to obey his parents. The rest of the book shows him that his parents were wrong. My son is 5, teach him letters and numbers."
org.khankids.android,Constantly freezes. Seems like well-rounded instruction with some curriculum coverage insight. But it freezes on almost every other song. Running on brand new Pixel 10 Fold. Have tried restarting app and phone
org.khankids.android,Amazing for my kids.
org.khankids.android,So easy to use and makes understanding quicker
org.khankids.android,it was so lagguy
org.khankids.android,"If you are looking for a good educational app for your kids, this is the one I use with my 2yr old son. He likes it and it's free with a bunch of stuff. It'll read books to him. has learning songs, and sorting, letter, number games. It also grows with your kid 👍 the only work it needs is you have to be very precise with the drag and drops in the games."
org.khankids.android,"I was looking for something educational to get my 3 year old grandbaby off of Pikmin and Astrobot. After looking through several apps, Khan Academy with its graphics, stories, informative animal and science videos, math games, learning levels, logic,etc..looked very attractive. I downloaded it (free!!) and tentatively introduced it as another game to my grandson. Now, he can't get enough of it! He is always exploring the Library and learning, and showing us his achievements!! THANK YOU so much!!"
org.khankids.android,very good
org.khankids.android,good 👍
org.khankids.android,they love it and I think it is a nice supplement to school.
org.khankids.android,brilliant app.im first time happy with any app .this is the app which is really a fun teacher for kids.

io.linga,"Приложение очень хорошее, мне все нравится, но исправьте пожалуйста проблемы с загрузкой офлайн словаря, я начинаю его скачивать, он грузится грузится, а потому начинает сначала грузится и я никак не могу его скачать, и было бы хорошо если б добавили функцию, что можно выбрать какие тренировки на повторение у вас будут, то есть не смешная или какая-то одна, а чтоб сам выбрал их несколько и запустил, потому что например у меня не всегда есть возможность делать тренировку где надо слушать слова."
io.linga,thank you very much for a comfortable app!🙏
io.linga,loveee this so far
io.linga,it's the best choice for those who aims to improve their reading in a language they are learning !
io.linga,I LIKE YOUR APP! would buy the lifetime for sure when i'm in my payday.
io.linga,"The library is weak but other than that, it's a good app. I will buy the pro version. Also i want one more feature: Advanced book speech like elevenreader."
io.linga,It would be great if the reader's settings were saved per book. I need to actively switch between center and normal alignment when I switch between scripts and books.
io.linga,the best reading and learning languages app I ever seen! tysm who created it
io.linga,not free
io.linga,Para leer en otros idiomas es la mejor aplicación.
io.linga,it is very useful app. very easy to create flash cards. several learning modes. perfect for reading books in different languages
io.linga,"um dos melhores apps para a leitura digital. Além de ser simples e prático, é bastante eficiente para aprender um novo idioma. Merece 5 estrelas!"
io.linga,Отличное приложение для пополнения словарного запаса через чтение книг на английском. Очень приятный дизайн.
io.linga,"Absolute rubbish, I am a complete a1 at German but even the ""a1"" books have complex words and unreadability statistics, I'm not b1, SO I guess can't use the app🙄"
io.linga,"porfavor,alguna opción para activar los phrasal verbs y se pueda distinguir en el texto,los prashal verbs son de lo más importante y si en el texto las palabras se traducen individualmente pierde todo el sentido lo que se está leyendo,eso es lo único que le falta a esta app"
io.linga,The best reader for language learners I have found.
io.linga,This is a real gem for intermediate and advanced language learners!
io.linga,Really helpful
io.linga,"Great concept, and a really helpful software for learning vocabulary. The best part is that flashcards and reviewing is built in, with varied exercises, and it's all automated! I'm looking for future enhancements of the features related to flashcards, because the app has the potential to become the ultimate vocabulary learning method!"
io.linga,c'est très utile pour ouvrir des livres J'adore Lire des livres sur Linga
io.linga,"The reading book percentage appears to be calculated incorrectly. Additionally, the page navigation slider is ineffective and functions more like a brightness adjuster."
io.linga,"This is what software should be like! Such a high quality application, where I'm always amazed with the features it provide. This has been a great aid on my language learning journey."
io.linga,Perfect app to read books and learn language
io.linga,parallel text !!! we all need that !
io.linga,overall is super useful but I'd like to listen to the books and perhaps different types of exercises to review vocab
io.linga,удобно для чтения. нету рекламы
io.linga,"very nice app to practice English, I love the selection-traduction function..The only thing that I would change It has a lot of beginner levels books"
io.linga,"Very useful application for reading. But one more detail, please, add the seats field for news and articles, because I can't find the articles, for example, that I read earlier"
io.linga,great!
io.linga,"Excelente app, me gustaría que funcionara offline."

com.codeway.homework,"This app is as good as all the other AI Tutor apps, but you need a subscription to use it though & there's a lifetime subscription where you never have to pay."
com.codeway.homework,Does not give correct answers
com.codeway.homework,good
com.codeway.homework,It was horrible and I was really disappointed
com.codeway.homework,Lifetime subscription not real I paid for the Nerd AI subscription in November 2024. on 19 January 2026 they removed my subscription and when I provided the billing information to the support email and they said no its not their accounts even though nothing changed. The droped the price from $43.00 to $39.00 now for the life time account. I want this resovled or I will seek legal counsel to request the max for the bait and switch marketing.
com.codeway.homework,helpful with difficult problems
com.codeway.homework,Awesome tool. must have!
com.codeway.homework,you can get whatever you're looking for but when I download something it takes like an hour to download and something don't even work so I gave it 4 stars

co.wordupapp.app,Hi. It tells mw to turn on notification everytime I open this app. Add a don't show this again or something. And I cant turn off those weird ai images. Paying money and facing these is not expected. Please at least make it easy for people who paid for it.

co.wordupapp.app,"You destroyed the app, this is so gamified that it's difficult to actually enjoy learning, AI images? Taking to AI? totally useless. I can't even find the breakdown of the word with examples as I used to, sad this has become an 8 year old type of experience."

tinyleo.com.grammarai,Grammerly teaches me writing skills.
tinyleo.com.grammarai,very good 👍 and nice
tinyleo.com.grammarai,way to expensive
tinyleo.com.grammarai,"Great grammar checker. Fixes spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and phrases. Enhancer or Rephraser fixes your sentence structure and vocabulary with lots of choices in variety in the paid version. only con is you have to paste text into app to fix, then paste finished text back to document."
tinyleo.com.grammarai,not free and not running 😏
tinyleo.com.grammarai,"Rene Villanova, my info should t be advertised so loosely. But if for communication purposes than be my guest."
tinyleo.com.grammarai,so good
tinyleo.com.grammarai,I thought it would be free
tinyleo.com.grammarai,This app needs to be fix.. And it better not charge me in 3 days. how do i cancel this app sucks

com.ereflect.wordela,"Great app, except it keeps asking to sign in after being unused for a while, if Google is used as the sign-up method. Hope it gets fixed soon 👍"
com.ereflect.wordela,"Just started, love it."
com.ereflect.wordela,Wordela is the best vocabulary and spelling development program from all the other programs that I have used in the past years.
com.ereflect.wordela,One of the best vocabulary building apps that I've seen. Very comprehensive and gratifying
com.ereflect.wordela,really good app so far I haven't bought the premium version yet but one complaint I do have is that I can't toggle off my dictionary function. When reading the basic summary of the word. I also suggest that we be able to edit the summary or word definition to our liking.
com.ereflect.wordela,I'm using it and everything works fine. only when I want to practice spelling I have to turn off the app after every session because the next one will not load
com.ereflect.wordela,This is a really good app i really like it
com.ereflect.wordela,This app would be oh so perfect if it wasn't so buggy. I hope to see changes very soon.
com.ereflect.wordela,"Sign up with Google exists, but doesn't work. Tried three times - nothing happens after( The Learn vocab feature doesn't work: ""User doesn't have access to wordlist"". I created this list to study, who else has access to it if not me?!"
com.ereflect.wordela,Good one
com.ereflect.wordela,Glitch bad Ui not recommended
com.ereflect.wordela,I can't sign in with google login with my phone. Sign in blinking and not redirect only visible login window. How to fix that?
com.ereflect.wordela,Vocabulary with definition is very useful for the beginners.
com.ereflect.wordela,Very nice vocabulary builder. Well done!
com.ereflect.wordela,Unable to login to my existing premium account (which uses google login) :(
com.ereflect.wordela,Unable to login after so many try.....
com.ereflect.wordela,I love wordela. This helps me improved my vocabulary.
com.ereflect.wordela,I love this app! This app helped me improve my vocabulary.
com.ereflect.wordela,I couldn't get past the login screen to try out the app
com.ereflect.wordela,Great App ❤️
org.brilliant.android,"The In app ads are so beautifully designed. I love to watch these ads, that's why I'm not buying premium ❤️🙂"
org.brilliant.android,"App is great for beginners also good for preparing to math. Plus, i can also improve my English. Thanks for that treasure 😊"
org.brilliant.android,Very Excellent 👌👌👌
org.brilliant.android,good
org.brilliant.android,Great effort!
org.brilliant.android,I love this!
org.brilliant.android,"I liked it too much, and I'm excited to pay for the premium. But the free plan is too limited and it can be frustrating to start on that app."
org.brilliant.android,"I was honestly preferring to work on my laptop with this app, but considering the power is out and I'm waiting to go back to work, the app on my phone works like a champ. Excellent courses btw. I was low-key hoping for some chemistry courses to help understand PFA's and nuclear power plants better, though I have no problem waiting."
org.brilliant.android,idk what they're teaching me but I'm taking it
org.brilliant.android,liking the learning
org.brilliant.android,Be careful they charge for a full year at a time and do not honor any EU consumer laws regarding refunds.
org.brilliant.android,This is an amazing app... I just wish it wasn't so expensive. I'd rather this than a mobile game.
org.brilliant.android,estoy seguro de que es una excelente app que no solo enseña si no ilustra con un modelo didáctico y impulsado por preguntas que abren caminos para pensar de manera distinta y eso abre caminos por eso para mí es un 10 de 10
org.brilliant.android,very good app for beginners
org.brilliant.android,remove premium pls I want to get smarter for free but the ads are cool tho
org.brilliant.android,good
org.brilliant.android,Only difficult because of age and eye damage. No
org.brilliant.android,"I like the concept, but sometimes answers are just flat out wrong. At least once, I selected what I thought was the right answer, was told it was wrong, selected a different answer, was marked correct, then the explanation told me my original answer had actually been correct. I didn't see any immediately obvious way to report the error."
org.brilliant.android,"This plaform literally rewired my brain. Post learning with Brilliant, I became an upgraded human."
org.brilliant.android,This truly is... brilliant
org.brilliant.android,Beautifully Brilliant
org.brilliant.android,"I absolutely love this app, trains your mind, learn new things etc... but I reccomend adding more real world science stuff such as those in kurzgesagt section. that's what got me most interested but there aren't much lessons there so I suggest adding more in the same style."
org.brilliant.android,"actually fun user interface, explains it all AND fun. would recommend edit: on a 22 day streak now cuz koji"
org.brilliant.android,Mixes theory and practice for an optimal learning experience!
org.brilliant.android,Awesome app! Can you please offer biology and chemistry?
org.brilliant.android,free version
org.brilliant.android,best learning app
org.brilliant.android,brilliant Brilliant.
org.brilliant.android,"The app is simple and user friendly. I have zero complaints, even the free mode is great as is."

com.prodigygame.prodigy,"you basically need a membership to even go through the game, you can grind like crazy but, they update it all the time and it causes bugs through out the game, old prodigy was great but they ruined it with this whole membership now, mostly everything in shop you need memberships to buy, WHOULD NOT RECOMMENDED IT AT ALLLLL"

club.speakpal,"I have been using the SpeakPal application for over 2.5 years, and it has played a significant role in improving my English communication skills. Initially, I was provided with free premium membership, which added great value to my learning experience. However, this premium access was later withdrawn. Recently, I have observed that some users are again being offered premium membership, while I am not eligible for it. This has been a bit disappointing for me as a long-term and loyal user."

com.david.android.languageswitch,I'm tamilian wanna learn English but tamil option not available for this app very disappointed
com.david.android.languageswitch,Выделение в тексте не совпадает с тем что в данный момент произносится. Это очень усложняет попытки повторять текст вместе с диктором. Сделайте хотя бы в настройках возможность отключать выделение текста
com.david.android.languageswitch,One of the best things you need
com.david.android.languageswitch,"Too expensive. I was REALLY excited about this app because this is the best way for me to learn Spanish, but they only let you preview a few things before making you pay $44 for a year, or $4 a month. I'm really disappointed. 😔"
com.david.android.languageswitch,very useful
com.david.android.languageswitch,Looks like it has potential. Unfortunately they do not offer a proficiency test to match your current skill to their content. This leaves you casting about wondering what level you should be on. They don't offer a trial period so you won't have the opportunity to try it first. Looks like AI generated content which means that it may contain inaccurate expressions of the language that an actual speaker may sense to be incorrect.
com.david.android.languageswitch,AI slop app
com.david.android.languageswitch,really useful for learning languages!
com.david.android.languageswitch,"It is such an immersive App that helps with learning french, reading and understanding the use of words in normal settings and daily conversations. Highly recommended👍🏾"
com.david.android.languageswitch,Its amazing
com.david.android.languageswitch,"I hated it, I payed for the yearly premium version cuz I wanted to invest in my goal of the year (improving my japanese A1 to B1), but the learning dynamics are awful, as I English teacher I would never use this kind of structure to teach a language, I regret the money I spent"
com.david.android.languageswitch,يظهر انه يدعم اللغة العربية ولكن الكلمات تظهر كحروف منفصلة ومتداخلة
com.david.android.languageswitch,"Requested a refund within 24 hours and within the 14-day policy. Google Play declined and I contacted support directly, but haven’t received any response for several days."
com.david.android.languageswitch,I just started but I find it quite enjoyable. I didn't realize how much Spanish I really knew. Having both the Spanish and English stories on the screen at the same time helps me fill in the blanks. Being able to add words to my vocabulary list is great as well!
com.david.android.languageswitch,"The interface is terribly designed, when you repeat words for study, if you know a word and immediately mark it as remembered, you won't be able to listen to the next one. I bought a subscription for a year and couldn't imagine what I could download. The app is not ready in the Play Store. The texts are very strange, most likely written by AI.Can I get a refund for my subscription? I am not satisfied with the app."
com.david.android.languageswitch,"Got Premium, yet your A1 Arabic content doesn't have vowels (I am aware it's dropped later on)"
com.david.android.languageswitch,ganz gut
com.david.android.languageswitch,I wish this app also had Persian language support.
com.david.android.languageswitch,good method to learn fast and also keep updated about latest happenings in and around you.
com.david.android.languageswitch,Great way to learn. I'm really loving this app. I'm improving my French whilst learning about the culture and I'm an adult way.
com.david.android.languageswitch,l really liked it soo much it helps a lot.
com.david.android.languageswitch,"Clearly just AI generated. The text has grammatical errors and doesn't flow like a human person's writing. The voices are just plain and with no emotions. I don't see why anyone should pay for this. The paywall appears immediately, and based on the quality of the free content, it really should not have a paywall at all until the creators work out the kinks."
com.david.android.languageswitch,I subscribed up to learn Portuguese from my native Ukrainian. But it's completely AI translation which is really bad. It's impossible to learn a language when there are so many mistakes in the translation of a language learning app!
com.david.android.languageswitch,"So typical of Google Play store AND these app companies not being transparent IN THE BEGINNING that this app is not free but rather fee based. Additionally, they have you download their app, asks you questions about your interests and why you want to learn a new language, THEN DROP THE SUBSCRIPTION RATES ON YOU! That is not honest and not ethical conning people like this. Tell people upfront about fees BEFORE leading them on. You'll find they will appreciate this more."
com.david.android.languageswitch,"Not what it once was. I used to love this app, but recently, translations have more and more errors, and pronunciation is hit or miss. Many of the translations read/sound like they are AI generated/voiced, rather than made by native speakers, which I think is the source of many errors. It's still a great concept, and I give it a star for the news story feature, but the app is definitely not worth a subscription anymore."
com.david.android.languageswitch,it's ok
com.david.android.languageswitch,Very useful as an additional app for language study.
com.david.android.languageswitch,Good App. 👍
com.david.android.languageswitch,Enjoying reading stories in Spanish.
com.david.android.languageswitch,"while I am reading, I get pop up screens telling me I've almost reached my goal. I also get these screens when I try to replay the story. I have to close the screens 4 or 5 times because they keep coming back. it is really annoying. also...the beginner stories are too difficult. I cannot do the ""course"" because it requires you to answer questions before you can move on. the dictionary is very slow. I do this on my phone and keep my tablet handy with another translation app."

com.learnaibasic.app,Good library for age of AI
com.learnaibasic.app,"So far, this app has been great. I have been interested in learning about AI for a while now and want to learn about how to make my own AI or how to use other open source AIs however after completing the introduction section of the course it has asked some for some strange seemingly unrelated details such as my full legal name‽ also a lot of the content within the app such as images and maybe text (it's harder to tell with text) has been AI generated. Overall this app seems quite good."
com.learnaibasic.app,Nice program to learn basics of AI. It should come with new modulea.
com.learnaibasic.app,"The issued certificate does not provide any verification link or reference. There is no way to access or review it again after issuance. In practice, it is just a static image, which significantly limits its usability and credibility."
com.learnaibasic.app,wow you guys are wow

com.syubestgames.teachersimulator,too many ads
com.syubestgames.teachersimulator,"I like it, super fun and active.But it would be better with some more activities and relation to irl teachers."

com.hellotalk.aigrammar,it's nice but expensive monthly payment
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Just started using it. It is very good.
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,some times it works evry good. but these days it don't work on my phone.
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,its a bad app....Please don't installed it.
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,best app
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,this app is useless because it charges money to check error
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,useless
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,I had a very bad experience with this app.
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Bug! can't login.
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Very nice!
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"only 3 checks, then must pay a fee. not as good as other app."
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,the app is not working on my keyboard
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,good
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,WASTE OF TIME! DON'T BOTHER. I COULDN'T EVEN GET IT TO TO DISPLAY THE DIRECTIONS BEFORE I UNINSTALLED IT!
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"""hi Ai grammar can only check English"" even though its full english🤦 had to restart the app just to fix it making a 15 unskippable ads show up. Deleted."
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,İt is rubbish they are making app just for begging money
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,AI grammar is not picking
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Very good app 👍
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,It is useful for correct spelling
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"The app colors are blinding and the ui is unusable for me. They need a dark mode. Since I can not see the menus, I can't use this."
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,All English
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"I have no words for the effectiveness of this app. After using this app, my grammatical accuracy became 85%... I'm pretty sure it was well above 95% beforehand, just like: Yes, a woman CAN make a man a millionaire...given that he is a billionaire to start with."
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"3 free grammar check YO team plant potatos men, you gonna do better that seat down there"
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"I wrote something in English, and it says, the app can only correct English."
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Good 👍
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Waste
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Asked for money to continue but I don't have that much money
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"Based on my experience, this app proved ineffective and useless. A grammar check of a draft email yielded only two suggested word changes, both of which were unnecessary and inaccurate as the word was already what it suggested I change it to 🤷‍♀️ weird"
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Wow
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,5start for being unuseful app and very easy to uninstall
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,I DID NOT find the language that i want to learn wich is ( Persian )
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,I saw a nice rating in this application but there's no English lessons for Indonesian people I thought it will be nice if this app add only English
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"I think the app is worth it overall; however, there are a couple of improvements I'd suggest. First, each lesson contains important exceptions to rules and core concepts, but these are only mentioned once and never revisited. It would be helpful to have a section in the app where we could review these exceptions later. Second, the rewind and fast forward buttons would be more useful if they jumped to the beginning of each prompt or answer rather than moving arbitrarily 10 seconds at a time."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"In general, I like this app. Some criticisms are the AI function is a little glitchy. The voice recognition portion of the app relies on AI and I have to try multiple times for it to understand what I said. Although this app bills itself as conversational Spanish, a little grammar lessons would help. A general overview of conjugating verbs would be helpful. During the actual lesson recording, remove the big clock and replace it with closed captions. would be incredibly helpful."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,amazing app for any beginner
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"Absolutely incredible and effective. Don't waste your time with Rosetta let alone something totally goofy like Duo. And self teaching out of books will never be as effective as this. I've given honest efforts to all of the above and Pimsleur is the final answer. The only thing that MIGHT top this would be a college course. Just trust the process, you'll see. Shoot for lifetime all access and family sharing for $400 (50% off) when they run a holiday discount. Even $800 is technically worth it"
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"I live in South Texas and have a pretty good grasp on Spanish vocabulary, but I have done very, very little speaking... the first lessons felt like swimming through molasses, but by the end of each one I was smiling, because I was practicing a skill I had never used and mastering it!"
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,Ive only gotten to course 3 but so far I've really enjoyed all the extra ways there are to practise your laungage
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,best language lesson app I've used so far. Easy to use UI. Love it
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,very versatile and effective.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"I like it but the Android Auto implementation is not good. Open on phone to continue, um if I had phone at hand I would not be trying to use Auto. Please fix."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,so convenient!
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,Absolute joke. $800 for the access? give me a break.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"Great app, it's helping understand french easily. Wanted to flag that French level 3 lesson 22 audio cuts at 15 minutes."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,Great App but if you're Sober it makes you repeat over and over that you want a beer. Hard Fail.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,Te amo ♥️/♥️
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,it amazing try it out
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,Cancelled twice and they continued to bill me! I sent them a message and they finally cancelled ( Supposedly) but have not received a refund. Do not trust this company.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,I am so sick and tired of paying for this course that I have no control over how much I pay of for how long. you made cancel of the subscription over difficult to achieve. I want to cancel my subscription please
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"I’m learning Japanese and currently at Level 2 with Pimsleur. A hands-free AI tutor using this same speaking-first method would make this app one of the best language-learning tools available. Full lesson transcripts with selectable words to add to a master flashcard deck would be amazing. Adjustable playback speed and slightly tighter spaced repetition would also help. I review the previous lesson before moving on. Overall, it’s worth the money and very effective, especially at the beginning."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"good App, highly recommended for Arabic learners."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,keep processing my bill even I didn't use this app
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,learning with it.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,too expensive
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"Pros - Main lessons are audio only, great for driving. - Very effective for me, though I did already learn the basics elsewhere. - Regularly changes up how words and grammar get used, rather than using the same phrases over and over. Quirks - Doesn't teach much grammar directly, letting you figure out the patterns. Cons - Audio lessons aren't properly interactive. - ❗Forward and back on Bluetooth devices skips between lessons rather than seconds.❗"
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"Broken app. Buggy and glitchy. Freezes up. Also be prepared to restart whatever language you've been studying. You can't course select, this might be a bug"
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"I should say I'm learning Chinese Mandarin using this. They seperate the listening and reading/writing. I feel like I'm being taught at half speed. I don't want to stare at a ""free daily lesson timer"" while waiting for the AI robot voice to finish talking. Sometimes I don't hear properly and being able to read things like if it was a N noise or M noise, or B or P.. I'm hoping they add a feature to read what you're saying so I'll keep it installed for now. It seems like a good app for what it is."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"I was interested in an app that would allow me to practice my German. To the question ""How much German do you know"" I answered ""a lot"". The app then forced me to start at lesson 1 anyway, impossible to get ANY other lesson without paying. I tried the ""challenge"" mode where you have to speak into your microphone. The AI did pick up what I was saying, but some translations are bad: for example, for ""I understand English"" the expected translation was ""Ich verstehe"". As if ""English"" was extra... :("
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,awesome

com.education.android.h.intelligence,"I am writing to desperately request a refund for a subscription to Gauth: AI Study Companion that was charged to my GCash account today, January 27, 2026. This was a complete accident. The app was installed due to a ""missed click,"" and I have not used the platform at all. I am a student living on a very tight budget, and this money was strictly reserved for my tuition fees and my basic needs for my apartment (rent and food). already sent a couple of Mail earlier. waiting for your response."

com.podcast.podcasts,"terrible to use, constant ads, when yoy connect or reconnect to Android auto it doesn't automatically play"
com.podcast.podcasts,Aaaah. Easy and pleased me. I want it now. lol.
com.podcast.podcasts,"when I open it it just loads, like I haven't even seen what the app looks like. its just a white screen with a spinning wheel. absolutely trash , delete"
com.podcast.podcasts,"Edited Jan 2026: downloaded app on a new device, my subscriptions is full of podcasts I have no interest in and cannot remove. Pre-loading subscriptions is one thing but making it impossible to remove them from subscriptions is incredibly infuriating. Will be uninstalling."
com.podcast.podcasts,LOVE THIS APP!! It has every option on the planet to choose from!
com.podcast.podcasts,Can't get enough! The best paranormal podcast.
com.podcast.podcasts,"It's a good player. But why don't the podcasts segue ? If you are listening to a series, you have to select the next episode. That is annoying. Sort it out !"
com.podcast.podcasts,Awful ads that are impossible to hide quickly.
com.podcast.podcasts,it's 👍
com.podcast.podcasts,the app has pop up ads repeatedly on opening. today 1/2 way through an episode it stopped and repeatedly was popping up Google page after clicking through 3 more ads in a circle so after ten minutes of going in circles I deleted it. it is terrible in everyway.
com.podcast.podcasts,very easy to use
com.podcast.podcasts,So funny ! I love these guys.
com.podcast.podcasts,Doesn't work with android auto
com.podcast.podcasts,good
com.podcast.podcasts,Easy to use
com.podcast.podcasts,"autosubscribed me to several ""popular"" podcasts without permission or asking, auto downloading junk episodes like Joe Rogan onto my phone. Gross. Spammy. other apps never put me through this"
com.podcast.podcasts,i don't like that 😠
com.podcast.podcasts,The ads are full page and impossible to skip. The UI is mediocre. I was looking for a second podcast player and I'm going to keep on looking.
com.podcast.podcasts,Easy to use!
com.podcast.podcasts,it's a decent app period every now and again you will have delayed playback or it may randomly skip back 30 seconds but it's something you can deal with if you're trying to get away from Spotify
com.podcast.podcasts,"It's soo buggy, some days it works great, other times it glitches so bad you can get anything to load. Also all the adds get old..."
com.podcast.podcasts,I love this app

com.podcast.podcasts,the best n free
com.podcast.podcasts,ads too many
com.podcast.podcasts,great app
com.wonder,So fun! I love it.
com.wonder,free version not as useable as other reviews made me believe. there's only 1 out of 19 (that I could count) games available on the free version so it's like 2 minutes worth of use a day. not worth the space it takes up on my phone.
com.wonder,great game
com.wonder,"Great but I wish I could play my favourite games more then once each day!! I love the colour link, I have ADHD and Autism, and I'm frustrated by the fact that I can't just keep playing it, you get one new puzzle a day, and considering I pay for this that's not great - also colour link is only one of these practical games, it's a specific type like a maze, which allows focus while doing and winning, great for ADHD, but not when it's once a day. Range if games should be better ."
com.wonder,"I've been using this app on and off for years. it has devolved into a weird cash grab that feels just like every other game out there now. pay to get your streak back, this weird thing with the coins now. not a fan of the changes personally."
com.wonder,Feels like it could be fun but I don't have the money to prove it. And they *will* ask for the money
com.wonder,"Pleased with the app, but it doesn't provide a way to cancel my subscription."
com.wonder,singed up for a 7 day free trial and got charged for the month anyways. not sure why that happened because I wouldn't have done it. kinda irritated but guess I'll be more cautious
com.wonder,"helps exercise the brain , gives you rest from all the scrolling, and also sends reminders to get you back on track . recommend it for sure. 👌"
com.wonder,great brain games. a good mix of mental massaging
com.wonder,"Was 5 star but now ridiculous.You are now forced to compete in a level for 6 days at a time & 6 levels total.i made it to the last level/league in the top 3 and was thrown back into the same level again starting over?So glad I didn't purchase the lifetime membership! I enjoyed competing against myself,strengthening my weak areas,I loved the daily puzzles. There are some questionable answers in the speaking & reading sections & you can now purchase XP!? either with 💸 or points??"
com.wonder,great app so far
com.wonder,"Another ""Free"" brain game app thats NOT FREE! Most definitely not worth they cost"
com.wonder,"You need better comunication. Many times I find myself asking what the question is, or how the answer is to be entered. When you tell me I'm wrong because you failed to make clear what was expected."
com.wonder,good
com.wonder,Good way to keep the mind sharp
com.wonder,"I heard about Elevate because I was already using another of the company's apps, and I've been enjoying it quite a bit so far. I appreciate the way it tailors the user experience based on how well you do at different exercises, and gradually increases difficulty. I like the daily crossword and other games enough that I bought the yearly subscription. I've made ""brain training"" part of my daily routine thanks to Elevate."
com.wonder,Meh. The synonyms are weak and incomplete. Example: Synonym for plain: unimpressive does not make the cut. The free version does not really allow you to improve your memory which is key for elevating nearly energy skill.
com.wonder,such a fun daily little brain workout!
com.wonder,"wow this app is great, I was very surprised"
com.wonder,Exercises the brain whilst being fun
com.wonder,"it's free, so if it helps, bonus"
com.wonder,It is a very helpful and yet challenging app. It's also an entertaining app that helps pass time more meaningfully.
com.wonder,"This is OK, but I find the paid version quite expensive for what it is, even with 50% promotion. I'm therefore stuck with the free version as I can't see the value in premium at current cost."
com.wonder,These mental exercises are fun.
com.wonder,"it's a good app, it definitely would help you build your knowledge but I find it a little ridiculous how little games you can play in your free time (whether to boost XP or otherwise), the only things available if you're using it for free is the daily games and synonyms. other than that, there's nothing for you to do on the app. as someone who is young and unable to pay for subscriptions, its disappointing"
com.wonder,its so much fun to challenge yourself. I love it.
com.wonder,Great app with great mini-games that do seem to make a difference! I would highly recommend you give it a try! Thanks to all at Elevate.
com.wonder,Bought lifetime subscription 11 years ago and I keep coming back every few years to play these games. Worth the money!
com.wonder,I got the 7 day free trial. I canceled the trial before the trial period ended. but they still tried to charge my account an outrageous price of almost 30 dollars. despite contacting them they still try to charge my cashapp and debit card

com.soundcloud.android,Great app for new upcoming/underground artists. (But mainly for unreleased Faygo ✌️)
com.soundcloud.android,"App handoff (“Listen in app”) does not work in Opera, but works reliably in Chrome. Opera is able to hand off to other apps such as Youtube, which suggests this is an issue with SoundCloud’s app-link implementation rather than the browser or Android settings. App link opening is enabled at the system level. This is a minor annoyance, but I figured I'd draw your attention to it anyway."

com.engbright,"I bought the full version about a month and a half ago, but after an update, my purchase disappeared, and I lost access. 'Restore Purchases' didn't work at all. I reset Google Play, reinstalled the app, and my progress was gone. It's asking me to pay again for exercises and AI exercises I've already purchased. The support team is unresponsive. An update could wipe out your money and effort. Think twice before buying."
com.engbright,"I am so unfortunate because there is no Sinhala, my mother tongue, here. I kindly request that the administration of this application... please add the Sinhala language also."
com.engbright,체험 기간 없이 바로 결제가 되었고. 구글에 환불을 요청해도 거절당했다
com.engbright,It looks like an unfinished product that has just been developed by AI. The functions are very ordinary and there are many bugs.
com.engbright,Very good application for English learners
com.engbright,I thank this app is very good application for words practice
com.engbright,bence sonuna kadar hak ediyor. çok uygulama denedim. bu çok farklı ve gerçekten çok faydası var. şunu da unutmayın hiç bir uygulama tek başına öğretemez. Sizin de ayrıca yapmanız gereken şeyler var elbette.

com.engbright,لقد أخذوا نقودي دون تفعيل الإشتراك، بعدما قدموا لي خصم 80% ثم دفعت $37 بعدها أرسلوا إلي إيميل بأنهم ألغوا اشتراكي، وطلبوا مني دفع المبلغ الكلي دون خصم!! أرجعوا نقودي!!
com.engbright,"Me vendieron guías con explicaciones en un idioma asiático en lugar de Español, si estuviera completamente Inglés estaría bien, pero en un idioma asiático. La app fomenta el mal hábito de traducir en lugar de pensar en Inglés."
com.engbright,es muy intuitiva

co.riiid.vida,"I say it's a decent app but damn is there a lot of pay walls, you can't even practice the things you actually want to practice without it telling you to sign up for a subscription."
co.riiid.vida,今天被朋友推薦使用這款多益出題AI APP，介面簡潔好使用，還可以預測自己的多益分數，能夠把握自己的程度在哪個range裡，回答題目後還可以再問AI題目的詳解，是現代衝刺金色多益的好工具！
co.riiid.vida,예측점수가 높으면 기본적으로 제공하는 문제역시 그만큼 난이도있는 혹은 취약부분에 대한 문제 위주로 나왔으면 합니다.. 계속해서 쉬운 난이도의 문제를주기에 예측 점수는 높아졌지만 정말 학습진행이 된건지 의문이들어 스스로 취약부분을 따로 풀어보니 상당히 어려웠고 문제를 풀고나니 예측점수가 대폭 감소하는데 30 일동안 만들어지고 큰변동 없던 점수가 한번에 내려가는걸 보니 점수예측에 관한 신뢰가 조금 힘들어집니다.
co.riiid.vida,unusable without paying 150 dollars a month
co.riiid.vida,"Honestly, hands down, the best TORIC prep tool, got me a golden certificate. The AI prediction is unbelievably accurate. Now if there's a JLPT one it'll be a god sent."
co.riiid.vida,"It's just error messages, useless app that doesn't work."
co.riiid.vida,非常有用的app，三年來一直使用帶著我的成績節節高，希望這次能繼續帶我突破！
co.riiid.vida,半年間、有料プランでお世話になりました。TOEICを、620点から、910点まで伸ばすことができました。本当に感謝しています。
co.riiid.vida,"I believe this app is a valuable tool for preparing for the TOEIC test. It provides ten to twenty questions for users who are trying out the application, which I think is sufficient for those looking to prepare for the test over an extended period."
co.riiid.vida,am broke how could i afford $150 for monthly subscription
co.riiid.vida,Cannot even open just showing error messages
co.riiid.vida,"I can't believe how accurate the AI was!! This app was predicted that I would get 845 point in this test. Today (11NOV'24) is the date for the result of the test held at 27OCT'24, and I get 825 point in this test!! IT WAS CRAZY!! I would suggest everyone who want to attend the TOEIC test to use this app previously to improve the skill and experience this app!!,"
co.riiid.vida,good app
co.riiid.vida,サブスクしてるのに広告が出る 長文の翻訳がかなり雑なので信じない方がいい
co.riiid.vida,다 좋은데 버그가 있어요. 얼른 해결 부탁드려요. 고객센터 메일 적어주시면 버그 영상 보내드릴게요. 1. 어휘 암기중인데 동일한 단어가 나왔어오. 2. 버그에 걸렸는지 몰라요 알아요 뜻보기 눌러도 넘어가지 않고 무한 반복이에요. 3. Pc랑 모바일이랑 같아요.
co.riiid.vida,너무 비싸요
co.riiid.vida,good
co.riiid.vida,必要な機能や学習内容は備わっているけど、回答で納得いかないものが結構ある。文法問題以外だと解説も雑。 制作者は、もう一度問題を見直して文脈上どっちでも成立しうるものがないか確認してほしい。
co.riiid.vida,"Đáng lẽ tôi sẽ cho năm sao Nhưng tôi cần một phiên bản của chứng chỉ IELTS, hãy ra mắt Santa - AI IELTS đi mà, tôi sẽ vote 5 sao ngay cho các bạn"

co.riiid.vida,"helps a lot to prepare for ur toeic test, my actual toeic score is close to the one I achieved in Santa. thanks"
co.riiid.vida,It is a useful tool to learning English
co.riiid.vida,I love this app. It's useful in learning Toeic.
co.riiid.vida,文字のサイズを調整（大きく）出来るようにしてほしいです。宜しくお願いします。
co.riiid.vida,"I haven't subscribed yet. Test scores start high and increase when I retry, which is odd. The app functions well, but it's unclear which features are free or paid. It says ""You do not have permissions for the selected study"" without explaining the restriction duration. Yesterday, I couldn't access a study, now I can, then I can't again. Limitations are unclear. The cost is too high for me, and I don't see the value in buying it with current results."
co.riiid.vida,very good
co.riiid.vida,wonderful
co.riiid.vida,perfect
co.riiid.vida,かなり使いやすくて良いアプリです。 要望として、テーマアイコンを導入検討いただきたいです。（ic_launcher.xmlにmonochrome設定するだけで、工数かなり少ないと思うのでやってほしいです） また、dictationの問題のボタンがかなり小さく押しづらく感じたため、最低でも48.dp確保してほしいです。
co.riiid.vida,good
world.petr.vokabeln,"The App really helps me learn vocab for my French class! I like the dynamic sentence examples and the generated images. I share my word lists publicly in the app so that others might benefit from them. My next language to learn is Spanish and I will for sure use this app extensively. I wait for Dutch to become available in the app, that would be the the biggest cherry on top for me. Overall this is my everyday vocab learning app, no unnecessary gamification, pure vocab and examples."
world.petr.vokabeln,The free tier is generously good.
world.petr.vokabeln,"Extremely well designed app. I am happy that I can learn Anki style without the UI looking horrible. Pricing also very fair, and a lovely app experience! Fully recommend"
world.petr.vokabeln,ارجوكم اضيفو اللغة العربية
world.petr.vokabeln,"Very good app, there is room for improvement: 1. Add custom schedule for notifications 2. Fix sound bug, sound is missing after first round of words"
world.petr.vokabeln,Ease of use is smooth. Includes C2 level vocabulary which is rare. Highly recommend.
world.petr.vokabeln,The most comprehensive language learning app.
world.petr.vokabeln,Another ai service trying to sell subscriptions.
world.petr.vokabeln,add mandarin please!! and if you made vocab decks by hsk level and topic this would be fantastic app. currently learning mandarin and spanish would be able to use this for mandarin as well.
world.petr.vokabeln,"This is an excellent app if you are familiar with the language already, this app is not for beginners, since this app is a vocab trainer and not an all around language course, so if you are looking to expand your vocab, I really recommend this app!"
world.petr.vokabeln,"Amazing!! add Arabic, Russian, vietnamese amazing app."
world.petr.vokabeln,This is great!
world.petr.vokabeln,An effective method without games / without distraction. Lean Design.
world.petr.vokabeln,"I really like this style of learning. It's a very easy to use application. Very usable even on the free tier. The app uses AI extensively, but I don't think this is a bad use of it."
world.petr.vokabeln,"I hoped for the option to add my own flashcards to utilise the spaced repetition system. There's no Chinese which I'm interested in, but I will use it to improve my German and maybe Spanish. Not very optimised for multilingual use :c"
world.petr.vokabeln,"please, add another language for instruction there's no english-english or english-indonesia"
world.petr.vokabeln,"Adding new words is not a super smooth experience, but I really like this app. It's helping me a lot."
world.petr.vokabeln,"This app is honestly remarkable. Exactly what I needed to expand my french vocabulary and I find I am actually remembering the words it trains me. I also love that you can add your own words very simply (and that it's obvious which are your own and which are theirs), and I find the chat bot so incredibly useful - allows you to do various exercises at your own pace and the bot corrects the mistakes you make by explaining why what you said was incorrect (i.e. like a real teacher!)."
world.petr.vokabeln,"Edit: Developer solved a technical issue very quickly. App functions well and better than most others I've tried. Original: This app is an active scam. Do not buy it! App is fully featured in the free trial. However, when purchase premium, you find half the features are still locked behind a yearly subscription. To be clear, this is a 40 EUR one time payment, followed by a 50 euro yearly subscription, and users are deliberately misled into believing it's a one time payment."
world.petr.vokabeln,"While I choose i am a b2 or even c1 user, the app makes me start practicing words that are too easy unless I individually mark them as known, one by one. Bad start and I don't feel like exploring it more..."
world.petr.vokabeln,Good developer. responding fast. showing care about his app and customers
world.petr.vokabeln,"Awful software generated audio. The app asks for one of those trials you have to remember to cancel before you have actually used the app in any meaningful way. The Swedish beginner's cards had a major mistake within the first 10 or so. The app is just trying to teach you words in a vacuum, without mentioning singular/plural forms, verb tenses and the like. This is yet another AI-driven, a-dime-a-dozen apps trying to capitalise on automated translations and generic content, so don't bother."
world.petr.vokabeln,A true Hidden Gem beats all the flashcard apps for me ❤️❤️
world.petr.vokabeln,Very convenient and great app. Hope they will add also Goethe C1 words to the collection
world.petr.vokabeln,There are not many languages to learn (e. g. russian is missing)
world.petr.vokabeln,Bad
world.petr.vokabeln,It's an awesome app!
world.petr.vokabeln,"Definitely has a potential, but atm I'm finding it really annoying how it keeps resetting my progress if the internet is lacking. Doing cards in an Uber while it's going through a tunnel? Chances are, you'll have to redo them again, keeping track in your head what you remembered the last time and what you missed. Surely it shouldn't be that difficult to add some offline functionality and sync things later when possible. Once that's fixed, I'll happily change my review"
world.petr.vokabeln,amazing app. no ads and a more than enough free plan. what more can a person ask for
world.petr.vokabeln,"Seems great, but is there a possibility of adding more languages? The ones I'm currently studying (japanese, korean and estonian) are not there."
livio.pack.lang.en_US,"Always reliable, easy offline mode. I think offline mode nails it. Job well-done. I have been a user since 2014 ✌️"
livio.pack.lang.en_US,interested
livio.pack.lang.en_US,"This is truly the best FREE dictionary app on the Play Store! I’ve tried many, but this one stands above the rest. It’s fast, accurate, and loaded with the features I need. I especially love the clear pronunciation tool and simple, intuitive design. It’s reliable, easy to use, and honestly the ONLY dictionary I’ll ever need. Highly recommended! Two thumbs up and 5 stars from me! 👍🤩"
livio.pack.lang.en_US,"I really like this app, but please make some changes in the UI, the Search icon, can you change it into a bar at the top or on the bottom. having to tap on that icon kinda pisses me off. thanks."
livio.pack.lang.en_US,The best
livio.pack.lang.en_US,LOYALTY *****
livio.pack.lang.en_US,"very interesting, very easy to use"
livio.pack.lang.en_US,"a very complicated English, but a very good good app, because there is ads!🥰"

livio.pack.lang.en_US,cool
livio.pack.lang.en_US,"Excellent. English Dictionary – Offline App provides a reliable and user-friendly platform for looking up words, definitions, and synonyms without internet access."
livio.pack.lang.en_US,"Good for adults and students alike in their quests to write and speak good english. It has advantages over other dictionaries because of its simplicity, easy to use and above all, it's offline i.e. you can search words without data...cheers."
livio.pack.lang.en_US,"The app is really nice 👍🙂, but sometimes the meaning of words are often written in complex words, making it hard to understand the meaning of that word. other than that, the app is very nice"
livio.pack.lang.en_US,One of the best Dictionary apps I have ever used.
livio.pack.lang.en_US,Great experience
livio.pack.lang.en_US,Nicely helpful thanks

livio.pack.lang.en_US,"study and learn new words and what they mean, or what they are all about."
livio.pack.lang.en_US,satisfactory
livio.pack.lang.en_US,"It is beautifully created. My only problem now is the high pitched voice echoing through the pronunciation which is both funny and jarring. please do something about it, or not. I still like it."
livio.pack.lang.en_US,"I love this dictionary with no ads and works offline and have almost every possible word, so its my only go to dictionary. BUTTTT I recently switched to ios device and I couldn't find it in apple store, I higly urge the app owner to make an ios version too🙏"
livio.pack.lang.en_US,It's helpful👍
livio.pack.lang.en_US,"Honestly, it is well and programmed for simplicity."
livio.pack.lang.en_US,the dictionary is not working since November 2025
livio.pack.lang.en_US,very good
livio.pack.lang.en_US,State-of-the-Art Knowledge in the MOST concise available NATURE.

com.mosalingua.frfree,The best app to learn French easily and effectively. I'm impressed.
com.mosalingua.frfree,Easy to Understand and it is very helpful.
com.mosalingua.frfree,am enjoying my experiences here
com.mosalingua.frfree,I think it is helping learn faster than Duolingo. just saying
com.mosalingua.frfree,"great app even the free version is useful, I've been enjoying it very much. I still use duolingo but I like mosalingua too maybe even more than duo"
com.mosalingua.frfree,Easy to comprehend. Very interesting to learn. Thank you!
com.mosalingua.frfree,I'm soon becoming pentalingual
com.mosalingua.frfree,best app ever
com.mosalingua.frfree,"errores a la hora de responder los ejercicios. no te ponen, dentro de las opciones, las letras correctas."
com.mosalingua.frfree,it is very useful app .
com.mosalingua.frfree,"Great for a beginner like me. Vocabulary builder includes visual and audio cues, definitions and example sentences. Lessons are guided but you can push ahead if desired. App is fairly polished and attractive. Price for premium is reasonable."
com.mosalingua.frfree,for some reason I cannot load the app today. I already uninstalled and reinstalled. I have lifetime sub. please help. otherwise its a good app
com.mosalingua.frfree,A worthless app rendered useless by broken questions that are impossible to answer. You are told to spell the answer with the letters provided but the proper letter are not provided making the question impossible to answer correctly.
com.mosalingua.frfree,Je really like it hehe
com.mosalingua.frfree,All the Mosalingua apps freeze when launching them
com.mosalingua.frfree,C'est une trés bonne app pour apprendre la langue français et Anglistik et aussi autre langues Merci
com.mosalingua.frfree,So bad I can't use it
com.mosalingua.frfree,"La mejor app del mundo mundial para aprender un idioma. ¡El mejor método de memorización lo tiene mosalingua! Y lo mejor, ¡Es gratis y funciona sin conexión a internet! Sin excusas para aprender."
com.mosalingua.frfree,Very useful app. Lays good foundation for learning & more!! Kudos to team.
com.mosalingua.frfree,It is a great app to learn a language
com.mosalingua.frfree,Really good tool. Get full package it has lots of tools. Best you can share phrases you study elsewhere and add to your spaced learning. lots of room for notes too if that helps.
com.mosalingua.frfree,"I tried to access this site but it insisted on sending an access code to an email I don't use and ignored the email address I entered. I have uninstalled it.when I finally accessed the site I do not think it is precisely what I need. It is a fun way of learning and is obviously good, but please cancel my subscription. I cannot find anywhere on the site to cancel. Thank you for your prompt interaction with the email address."
com.mosalingua.frfree,The app is really good alot of words to learn and listen to. You should try it you will fall in love with it 😀😀
com.mosalingua.frfree,The best app ever
com.mosalingua.frfree,I like how this worked it just that it was kinda difficult for beginners as one myself. But otherwise its very good😊
com.mosalingua.frfree,"Great app, much more effective than any other French learning app I have tried. It actualy keeps me interisted, and I learn so much faster. Just one request, is it possible to add an option to play the recording you have to learn from, in slow-motion? Some of those phrases are quite quick and to a non-French ear it sound rather, well, chaotic. If I could listen to it a bit slower, even just once, I would be able to grasp the sounds better. Other than that, it is a perfect app! Good job! ☆"
com.mosalingua.frfree,Magnifique
com.mosalingua.frfree,Disingenuous notifications. 0 stars.
com.mosalingua.frfree,So entresting
com.mosalingua.frfree,"Had been using the free version of the app every day for about a month and it was great for improving my vocabulary.It became part of my routine so signed up for premium which was also great. It froze/crashed yesterday and I had to uninstall. Emailed their IT support, they solved the problem and responded within a few hours to let me know they had fixed the issue. Didn't even lose my progress when I reinstalled.The app is working great again."
com.funeasylearn.phrasebook.french,I forgot alot of my french the free app part great
com.funeasylearn.phrasebook.french,"Hands on, this is very easy to learn in small bites"
com.funeasylearn.phrasebook.french,Great 👍 for learning French.
com.funeasylearn.phrasebook.french,"My absolute favorite French learning app! I have tried every foreign language learning app I have run across on The Play Store, in my attempt to become multilingual. A good phrasebook, which helps one to learn the more idiomatic, everyday phrases, is as necessary as a dictionary, verb tables (to visualize forms), a good grammar, and some means to interact with a speaker of the language (or, at the very least the ability to hear an active speaker), when hoping to become multilingual."
com.funeasylearn.phrasebook.french,👍🏼
com.funeasylearn.phrasebook.french,"I am learning with this fantastic app! Easy and without Internet connection, it's great, thanks!"

com.duocards.app,"worked great in the beginning, but now super slow to load"
com.duocards.app,"positive, I always leave flashcards for Later because I can't be bothered studying them, so I'm glad it forces me to study them before I can watch something lol"
com.duocards.app,"Love this app, so useful."
com.duocards.app,"Thanks to this app I've learnt tons of vocabulary in Italian, French and English, thanks for this. If anyone's wondering if it's worth it paying the subscription, it absolutely is."
com.duocards.app,What I love about DuoCards is that the people who made it still care about the people who wants to learn. While most other apps are trying to make as much money as possible these guys are genuinely willing to help people learn a new language.
com.duocards.app,I hope that in the next update there will be a feature on how to pronounce a word properly especially learning English . thank you
com.duocards.app,"I really like the DuoCards app, but I have 3 suggestions for improvement. 1) The pronunciation of the word “compulsion” is incorrect, please check 2) It would be great to have different English pronunciation/vocabulary options, as I need Australian English. 3) When tapping a word, the dictionary should allow users to choose between different parts of speech instead of selecting one automatically. Overall, the app has strong potential, and I hope these improvements will be implemented."
com.duocards.app,It's the best app!!! Thanks for constantly improving it!
com.duocards.app,"App will not work without purchase. Falsely claims to offer a limited ""free"" option. After enrolling, it asks if I want to subscribe without offering a ""no"" option. Can't close ""subscribe"" screen, restarting app returns to ""Subscription"" screen."
com.duocards.app,love it
com.duocards.app,"I tried this app. I subscribed, then cancelled when I realized it would not work for me. they kept my money and said they would cancel after a year. I requested it immediately. check my usage data."
com.duocards.app,learning is good
com.duocards.app,es muy bueno practicar en duo cards palabras porque las aprendes fácil y rápido .
com.duocards.app,"I Like the cards functionality, but the test chat makes a lot of mistakes"
com.duocards.app,"I don't usually give out ratings, but man, just get this app. It's: 1.) A true language learning freemium app. Very usable without payment and the ""ads"" aren't annoying either. If I had the money, I would get it just as a donation to the devs for making such a fine app. 2.) AMAZING for vocabulary, explains words, generates nice icons, allows you to answer by typing out the answer or saying it out (you can also just flip the card) -Include AI feature that accepted nuance (e.g. Es-tu vs. Tu es)"
com.duocards.app,"I don't understand why such a simple application can't be made offline, it's impossible for the words that I learn to be downloaded to my phone. And this is all despite the fact that I have the paid version"
com.duocards.app,"Simple, cheap and helpful. I love it."
com.duocards.app,I'm glad you kept your promise.
com.duocards.app,the best application
com.duocards.app,its really good and I think it will be a very good source but from my experience after like 27 flashcards? it wouldn't let me do anything unless I subscribe and pay so I won't say it's bad but it's also not good in a way 👍
com.duocards.app,"The best language learning app of all time and space. After installing this app, life became more beautiful, and learning languages became easier.This app in 10,000,000 stars. Thank you very much to those who developed it."
com.duocards.app,"Die effektivste App zum Vokabellernen, die ich je ausprobiert habe! Hilft wirklich sehr gut beim Einprägen der Wörter und ist niedlich gestaltet. Macht sehr viel Spaß, danke fürs Erstellen der App :)"
com.duocards.app,"This app would have been a clear five-star one, weren't it for the fact that it doesn't really realize its potential (I'm a subscriber). AI coupled with flashcards is a powerful combination, but grammar explanations all look the same (they should be more varied and complete) and examples are often repeating. The Listen feature is very powerful, but we should be able to filter by set of cards. This together with a better production of examples would be great. Looking forward to updates."
com.hellotalk,it's so good I made a lot of friends
com.hellotalk,really easy to meet new people
com.hellotalk,ماشاء الله رائع جدا
com.hellotalk,not good app you have money you cane use
com.hellotalk,Please revert the previous search bar function so that we may find user accounts again instead of just chat history
com.hellotalk,mostly the app is good. recently it is giving the users a feature to try VIP free for temporary period. unfortunately I I am failed to try. I do not see the feature on my app unlike others are having.
com.hellotalk,after signing up the app freezes and doesnt function. Ironic it froze on the screen asking to rate the usability of the app.m not 3 minutes after download
com.hellotalk,This is not very safe..I just Opened an account and the a unknown guy continuesly disturbed me by voice call and video call...I just logged out and uninstalled this app.This is very disappointing.I hope Hello Talk could work on their customers privacy in future.(I gave one star so that I could post the comment.)
com.hellotalk,some fake users are also there..
com.hellotalk,bad app
com.hellotalk,I like this app
com.hellotalk,hope is there any new free staff
com.hellotalk,i cannot download this app. i would eagerly like you to fix it as soon as possible.
com.hellotalk,I love this app . people inside it are very kind and also good to use and learn a new language from both sides
com.hellotalk,"The main thing of the app is to find the learners and have a dialog with them. But guess what? No one replies (at all), neither men or women equally. Meaning that people are not using this app for its purpose at all, or they are not even logging in (maybe the app is 100 years uninstalled) or it is just full of bots. I don't know what to say. Paying for the app is totally nonsense obviously. Good concept, but at the end of the day the app became another Instagram, which no one needs. Pitiful."
com.hellotalk,بعض الناس يرون أنه جيد ويقيمون التطبيق خمس نجوم عشان كونو اصدقاء بس فى ناس تقول انو مش كويس بس عشان هو مضيعة للوقت ومش للتعليم وانا مع الرأى الاول😎
com.hellotalk,🥱
com.hellotalk,Lots of apps relating to bugs. Please fix the mic glitch and typing is too slow. The server of this app is pathetic. Need to upgrade a stable update with UI performance improvements. Please add options to fix a crystal clear sound with background noise cancellation should be added. The app notch needs optimisation with running and closing should be implemented.
com.hellotalk,love this
com.hellotalk,I selected more than one language upon signup thinking I could interact across those languages. The app defaulted to the last one I selected then paywalled the rest with no way to change it. Terrible app - with intrusive ads that try to get you to pay and signup before you even try it. Avoid.
com.hellotalk,"Great app and there are a lot of people who genuinely teach the language but I'm hoping that the age range could be filtered easily both in finding a practice partner and in voicerooms. Sometimes, voicerooms have mixture of minors and grown people and the topics aren't nice so it's good to filter the age range in voicerooms as well"
com.hellotalk,because limeted acces for voiceroom
com.hellotalk,nice but ads and ads....
com.hellotalk,nice
com.hellotalk,"I used to use this app a while ago then I uninstalled it then I just reinstalled it today and apparently I can't access the voice room it keeps on saying "" the feature is not available in your region"" and I an see people from my country accessing it so I don't understand what's happening,,,could you fix it cause I wanna use the app😢"
com.hellotalk,The Best platform for language learning.
com.hellotalk,"This app is really good and I enjoy using it to make friends with foreigners and learn about other cultures. However, the last update is disappointing. When you download a photo, it now has a “HelloTalk” watermark at the bottom, which ruins the photo. It’s especially inconvenient if the original photo was deleted. I hope you can remove the watermark or give users the option to download photos without it."

com.linguist.fr,Très utile et claire et sample. Un excellent professeur.
com.linguist.fr,c'est super
com.linguist.fr,I can't seem to get past the 'How time can you commit to learning french page'🥀
com.linguist.fr,amazing
com.linguist.fr,excellent
com.linguist.fr,"pretty bad, use another app"
com.linguist.fr,good 👍 and very good
com.linguist.fr,"No idea what this app is like because it won't let me create an account with a Google email. Does nothing, just returns you to the create account page. There are too many apps out there to continue to try with one that is so difficult to access"
com.linguist.fr,Oops Q edit YES OMG VHX THANKS THX SO MUCH FOR THE LIKES EVER I GOT THANKS SO MUCH! haha way funny I Kayed so funny! And did you Kaiessed?
com.linguist.fr,It's worth the time
com.linguist.fr,"On the second page, it said I have to pay to continue. That wasn't even enough time to know whether it's worth paying for. Uninstalling."
com.linguist.fr,Offers stories and lessons in Quebec French!
com.linguist.fr,"Amazing app, thank you!"
com.linguist.fr,So far so good. I like it. I like reading so it's good to have a story to follow.
com.linguist.fr,"I am a little bit too new to know for sure, but it sure seems like what I have been looking for. The app is sure user friendly. Thank you."
com.linguist.fr,Best language learning app I've encountered
com.linguist.fr,"Great 👍 app. I paid for lifetime fee because I'm using it everyday. Reading and listening 🎧 together has helped me a lot understand french. But of course you have todo a lot of other things like speaking practice,SrS and translation."
com.linguist.fr,Best⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
com.linguist.fr,"was learning french and then suddenly clicked on a word when it said ""go premium"", u can apparently only learn 20 words?? after that u cannot learn unless u have premium. Uninstalled immediately."
com.linguist.fr,Good
com.linguist.fr,Great app
com.linguist.fr,"Enjoying it so far, but progress doesn't sync well between devices. I'm using the same account between and android and an iPad, but I only earn coins through the ipad. It is a quibble but my feelings of engagement would be higher if my experiences of the app were the same on both devices."
com.linguist.fr,"Google Sign-in Not Working When you try to sign in with Google, the screen just shakes and prompts you to sign in again and again."
com.linguist.fr,I take back what i said i was angry
com.linguist.fr,Excellent tool to increase the knowledge of french. It takes a bit to get use to the way the app works but it is indeed a very good tool to practise a bit of french every day. There are a lot of resources so you can always find stuff that interest you and keeps you motivated. In my opinion there should be more freedom in regards of the words you want to save and learn but there than that it's really great
com.linguist.fr,"Some really helpful lessons in here for those of us that need to listen and speak. Stories for context some with visuals and the ability to break them down a sentence at a time to repeat after them or listen over and over until you ""get""it ."
com.linguist.fr,This app is awesome! Love the versatility and choice. You can't get bored with the app😊
com.linguist.fr,"The registration process using neither Google nor Facebook works. So, the app is useless."
com.linguist.fr,It is a very nice app
com.linguist.fr,The best so far.. exactly what i been looking for.. 👍👍👍👍

com.ielts.speechace.ieltsace,Well think again before downloading... No matter how clearly you say it... It'll always give you a low score
com.ielts.speechace.ieltsace,I paid for full access with Google Play on June 7th but never got access despite complaining via the feedback button. I also tried paying for premium on their website to no avail. It seems like the devs are no longer active or something.

ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"Used to be much better. It is now really predatory with its demanding money every 5 seconds. Used for a couple of years, now uninstalling."
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,great app
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"Rating it 4 cause it turns off itself sometimes but aside that best app, been using it for 3 years and it's been great"
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"UPDATE: canceled my subscription and they're still charging me 3 months later. SCAM! GARBAGE. Even with the top tier pricing plan you can only check 6K words at a time, so if you're using it for anything longer than an email it's basically useless. And it does a terrible job actually fixing your punctuation and grammar. I found more mistakes after running a few pages through the program than I started with. I"
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"It is a very helpful app. It was an accidental purchase. I've had the app on my phone for some time now. I seen free trial and obviously went for it. I needed it for my GED classes, which I still don't have the money for either. I wanted my Grammar on point! Now I feel like I'm out $40. Great app for sure just be careful with the free trial offer, on the plus side I did get like 30 or 70 play points or so it seemed but hey free play points yay!!!! ""tired"" !!!"
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,perfect
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,very best to use
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,Absolutely.Love has helped me become a better writer
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"I kept losing my work! No i did not delete it. Does savevto something like a. clipboard? If so, where might I find it. Also, the keypad to this app is not easy to navigate. It add's letters causing correction major time. Don't worry, i did not sign up to use their app on a payment basis. But please if here is somewhere i would find my vwork let me know. Thank you."
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,your app deleted my entire essay
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,best
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,need free version with adds
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,good app
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,i would like the app that corrects your text messages when you aretexting it was on my phone but i lost it could you help me i am 89years old and i would like the help in getting that app back thank you very much
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,I love this app I haven't been having any problems so far.
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,It's broken.
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"I pay for grammarly yearly subscription, I cant sign in the app on my new phone. theres no option and if you think you can chat with a representative ha try again because they are never available"
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"Don't bother, overpriced and just not very good! Now for weeks of trying to cancel scam subscriptions, NOT easily cancelled- BEWARE!"
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,I don't want this app
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"full-screen advertisement and locked, cannot exit, force you to install random software..SCAM"
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,very good app. but advertisement is so many.
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,Great app
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,I did not they were charging me.
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"Used Grammarly for years. The extension used to be one of the most useful tools for writing emails etc. Now it's probably the worst option in its category for writing while also being easily the most expensive and least feature rich. To top it all off, they absolutely bury the unsubscribe button beneath all of your invoices. Cancel subscription doesn't even appear as an option on a mobile browser unless you scroll to the very bottom of the invoice list. Feels scummy and really disappointing."
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,good
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,An awesome app for those people who want to receive support at different levels of grammar and writing difficulties. I am happy with all the services.
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"I have attempted to contact customer service on two occasions because there is no sound and no vibration from the keyboard, and all I ever get is the answer that they're not available, and they will get back to me. No one ever gets back to me, and they're always unavailable. That is why I dropped this app once before."

com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,great
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"The app is smooth, and the courses are very intuitive. I love it and I recommend this for those who want to learn new languages."
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"There are a lot of language learning options through this service and they all use the method popularized by ChinesePod from the early-2000s. It's a great method. Some of the banter between teachers is kind of cringe but otherwise the lessons are pretty good. I've used this for Cantonese, Japanese and Italian. The app needs to be updated. Lots of old UI elements and no way to favorite lessons or add them to a custom list."
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,Gorgeous! 😍😍
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,the app is great. l find it best to learn any language's you would like to learn

com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"A lot of functionalities are missing from the app. After a 4 days usage, I see no advantage using that app over heading to the Hungarian pod 101 website and using the web app instead, except the very useful lesson downloads. I think it would be great to have all the flashcard stuff in the app. Nevertheless, the app works well, I did not yet encounter any bug. A functionality to play all reviews in a playlist would be great."

com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"having used dualingo, this one is not so good. Starter lessons are fast and not fun at all. app is boring and needs some interaction. all in all, it's not great and it is expensive. also always pushing premium in your face all the time is annoying."
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"Great language learning app at any level. The most basic level alone is worth the money. The way they teach is very effective, moreso than other apps I have used. I highly recommend it!"
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"good teaching method for a second foreign language but if your goal is english, then the app is pretty poor. also i miss many functionalities from the website in the app like flashcards and the the thematic word lists also poor interactive layer - why not to give us an option to practice the sentences under Word of the day (fx first read the sentence then write it yourself) it's very passive learning and one learns only through active learning"

com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"It's been quite a while since I last looked at HP101. It now looks to be a heck of a lot better than it once was. I'm suitably impressed and, based upon what I've seen so far, I would highly recommend it. (Using it on both cellphone and desktop.)"
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,you say it's free but it isn't.

com.daily.micro.learning,"Why should I pay, when all the material being covered is freely available on the internet?"
com.daily.micro.learning,"All the questions at the beginning are annoying...'do you sometimes need a little push, what do you hope to learn etc. I got up to question 9 and then uninstalled. Sometimes you just want to jump straight in 🤷"
com.daily.micro.learning,AMAZING FUN FOR LEARNING AND PROGRESSING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EVERYTHING
com.daily.micro.learning,pico have to much knowledge which i love to learn thanks for this app.
com.daily.micro.learning,good
com.daily.micro.learning,totally cool! I love this and I just started
com.daily.micro.learning,"Short learning sessions, makes learning easy. I have a short attention span. This makes it great for me."
com.daily.micro.learning,"asks you a bunch of questions to get you committed and waste your time, then tries to get you to pay for a subscription"
com.daily.micro.learning,this is by far the most educational and fun app out there. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning everything.
com.daily.micro.learning,Super informative and fun to learn!
com.daily.micro.learning,A great way to learn.
com.daily.micro.learning,instantly helped me figure out what's taken me months to connect the dots with!

com.daily.micro.learning,Such a good app it helps you to understand every thing also helps very much in exams
com.daily.micro.learning,Very good app it helps me study facts and other things
com.daily.micro.learning,I Uninstaller the app. after it ask it seems like 20 -25 questions. I think it just a questionnaire site for your data.
com.daily.micro.learning,Taking one look in the app and it's just AI generated slop.
com.daily.micro.learning,I'm just going through History now but there are many subjects to explore. I'll be busy for awhile.
com.hello.french,5 stars deserved
com.hello.french,Wow!!! Blown away! This is the best way to learn a language. The developers put in a lot of work to structure this app such that it caters to readers/learners of all levels. Every word is translated and shown how it is used in context. Grammar rules are explained in depth and the daily exercises ensure that you learn every word and understand what it means.
com.hello.french,"definitely more of a mature app than duo in just a few minutes I realized this app will take me a lot farther in my desire to learn a language by actually teaching things that can be used in real time applications with less unnecessary stuff like leagues and gaming mentality that do not interest me, or teach anything."
com.hello.french,"This is an amazing app to learn a new language, I am using it to learn french and it makes language learning so easy. I wish I knew about it earlier, but either way I am happy to have found it. super 💯💯💯."
com.hello.french,"the app is easy to use and understand, and it teaches quite well too in a way that's not overwhelming. it's quite effective, but a lot of the content is limited. either way, i still enjoyed it quite a lot!"
com.hello.french,The app is beautiful and I love that there are various options that help a beginner. I just hope that they translate the title of the article in french as well and if they can add one or two more paragraphs in the articles. I love to read more and improve. Otherwise no issue at all.
com.hello.french,nice app

org.khanacademy.android,"I tried many ways to learn mathematics—YouTube videos, ChatGPT, and other resources—but the learning was not in a proper order. Because of that, I often felt frustrated. I could not track my progress or clearly understand where I was weak. Khan Academy solved this problem for me.

com.tv5monde.apprendre,bery useful and educational for the people who wants to know a new language
com.tv5monde.apprendre,An infinite source of learning material not only of the French language but also of the Francophone world. Enthusiastically recommended to all who take learning French seriously.
com.tv5monde.apprendre,pas mal
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Another great way to learn french. I like this method
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Good resource for learning French
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Best learning app for french
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Good app but need more explanation for grammers
com.tv5monde.apprendre,A great application and it has really helped my vocabulary
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"it's great with the built-in translate option for transcripts, but can you also add the option to add words from transcripts to the words we need to learn, like a leitner box? it will be very helpful"
com.tv5monde.apprendre,C'est une application incroyable vraiment elle m'aide pour prendre cette langue facilement
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Nouveau Intermediate B1 -- Allons y!
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"This app is all that you need to learn French. There you will find lots of exercises adequated to your level and the videos have transcriptions which is excellent for listening practice. What I do for a more effective learning is, after watching the videos, I repeat what was said with my own words and try to read something short about it. It's working really well."
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Provide some videos tutorials
com.tv5monde.apprendre,great for comprehension orale.
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"La aplicación no se puede usar muy bien cuando el teléfono está configurado en modo oscuro. Por otra parte, una falencia muy grande es que no es notoria una secuencia didáctica de los temas a trabajar por cada nivel. Solo es una publicación de lecciones con videos de manera aleatoria sin que haya una hilación entre las mismas. Esto es contraproducente para estudiantes iniciales, ya que llega a ser bastante confuso al no saber que lección va conectada con cuál."
com.tv5monde.apprendre,je trouve l'application merveilleux. Mais l'accès aux différentes parties pourrait être plus facile. excusez mes erreurs comme je ne suis qu'une apprenant de cette belle langue
com.tv5monde.apprendre,excelente aplicación! mucho mejor que Duolingo
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"Application parfaite, je l'aime beaucoup, elle est vraiment très utile pour mon apprentissage du français."

com.tv5monde.apprendre,"Really challenging, I love it."
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Free and helpful
com.tv5monde.apprendre,I love it
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Horrible redesign. I immediatly missed the old one. So sad to see some folks thought this is a better direction. I wish i could learn french before. (seriously... ibm font with plain white background and low quality sans-serif and... yellow ‽)
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Exellent App for French Learners
com.tv5monde.apprendre,C'est une bonne application pour pratiquer le français! J'adore ça!
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Super
com.tv5monde.apprendre,i like it .
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"I started learning words and the word ""répondre"" is translated as ""to meet"" (instead of ""to reply""). Thanks for the prompt reply!"
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"When gamified apps like Duolingo won't take you the entire way, TV5Monde gives you a much richer experience of the French language by providing real world stories and vocabulary you might not find in textbooks. There's even some features to help you pass the TCF. Quand j'ai besoin de pratiquer pour améliorer mon français, je trouve que cet appli est tellement indispensable!"
com.picoai.languageapp.android,"Freemium app. Has a paywall. Yes, it has funny videos of Japanese Pingo, but those are just promo. Duolingo or even ChatGPT is was better than this P2W app. Don't install it."

com.picoai.languageapp.android,it pushes a free trial forcefully to you and you cannot remove it ive been seeing people compliment this app on tiktok but the day after you download the app it forces you to get a free trial and you cant even deny it which is so annoying.
com.picoai.languageapp.android,im from Ethiopia Jan 26 joined to pingo ai to lern arabic language There will be a change in my schedule for the next 1 week. let's see🤔🤔
com.picoai.languageapp.android,"""Pingo AI has significantly improved my speaking confidence in [Language] more than traditional tutoring, with its natural AI conversations and helpful, real-time corrections. However, I would love to see more structured curriculum-based lessons to complement the free-talk, along with a more affordable subscription model to make it more accessible."""

com.appforge.saygo,"I’ve been using SayGO for a while, and it’s hands down one of the best language learning apps I’ve tried. The lessons are well-structured and follow the CEFR levels, so it’s easy to see real progress. I especially love the interactive games and daily vocabulary exercises—they make learning fun and keep me motivated. The AI tutor is also very helpful, giving instant explanations and guiding me through conversations step by step."
com.hellotalk.hellowords,failed to load
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"it's good for enhancing voc, but I thought I could use it as a substitute for HelloTalk, as I wanted to talk with strangers (I meant calling them and having conversations)"
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"Honestly the app is amazing in its array of vocabulary, images, and proper form of vocabulary in different languages (clearly they used natives and specialists) but you cannot review words at will. I am the type that needs to review words every day. if I can't I will lose it. So no matter how much I study, I do not retain the vocab because I cannot review it. such a shame."

com.hellotalk.hellowords,"Very very similar to Drops/Droplets. Looks like a blatant rip-off, albeit slightly lower quality/content/options. Still an effective vocab learning tool. Can't figure out how to purchase ""Plus"" without knowing Japanese."
com.hellotalk.hellowords,so good
com.hellotalk.hellowords,👏👏👏
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"I like the app but I have a really annoying problem, during an exercise, after only 4 seconds the app tells the solution... I hate it it's so annoying and counter productive. Can I delete the help in settings or something? I'll give 5 stars if yes."
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Good
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Amaxing
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Very good method for learning word
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Good
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"Immediately wants you to pay (if you don't, you get three free minutes a day, SO GENEROUS), and is absolutely manic and bananas right off. You have to know the language you want to learn going in! This is for expanding vocabulary NOT learning from scratch."
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Good
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"The app failed to load, after several attempts I still couldn't get past the first two questions before it crashed. I love hellotalk but hellowords simply did not work"
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Very good
com.hellotalk.hellowords,This is an exclusively amazing Language Learning App'.!!.
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Hello Talk has introduce me to use this resource to learn Korean vocabulary and phrases. It's a great method of learning to advance your skills.
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Awesome
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"Плюсы: Очень хорошая удобная графика и дизайн. Минусы: 1. Избранное не работает как отдельная тема. Слова не перемешиваются и избранное не отображается сверху с кнопкой ""возобновить"" 2. В упражнении между двумя картинками верхний всегда правильный. 3. В некоторых темах слова плохо подобраны. Обратите внимание на ""Здоровье1"", ""Здоровье2"". 4. Глаголы в теме ""Глаголы"" не в инфинитиве, а в склонении для ""Я"" 5. Из ""Hellotalk"" можно добавить только те слова которые есть в словарях ""Hellowords"""
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"I am currently using the russian course for my learning. I have noticed that it's like an improved version of the drops flashcard app. The minigames with spelling and matching is very helpful for remembering words. For anyone else that decides to learn a language with a different alphabet, I suggest acquainting yourself with the alphabet in order to do the spelling exercises."
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Very good
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Very interesting and informative app you should install it

ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,you truly deserve 5 stars for such an amazing app. The courses are so easy and bite-sized that I am actually wondering if I am really learning. the way you handled ads making it that you only see them when you want to begin a new lesson but didn't buy the pro version. I tried to pay but it couldn't go through because I am from Nigeria and she is not among the countries that can make payments using Google wallet. But I am sincerely grateful for you still making the lessons accessible.
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,awesome app

ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,Awesome app
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,very good and easy to learn
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,I'm actually learning something

ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,"This app has demystified the field of AI all the way. I've done some other research on the subject, but this app is helping me to gain an understanding of the content, as well as the confidence to continue through this journey and eventually be working in the field from home."
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,The future is now. The app is educational and useful.
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,good for beginners
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,"Any Wkipedia article or other open source information will give you much more information than this collection of banal texts, designed for elementary school students. Yes, seven dollars isn't much money, but you'll understand that other courses from this company won't teach you anything more than generalities. If you know absolutely nothing, this course might be somewhat useful for you, but don't expect any real knowledge that you could use. This isn't even an ABC book. It's just pictograms."
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,learner can definitely try for base 😅
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"Nice app, and the ads are not intrusive. I have generated learning cards using Gemini, but it was a bit tricky. Maybe you can add an example prompt and an example file for such a use-case."
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"огромное спасибо, замечательное приложение"
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"I really love this app. it's super helpful. but I hope there is a feature of categorising where I can see words relating to a similar topic even if the words are in different bookcases. Like words relating to job, or words relating to feelings something like that"
kr.co.devstory.vocat,Love it !!! It's so much simpler and easy to use more than other apps. Bonus point for being free and no ad interruption .
kr.co.devstory.vocat,please add a new features which data auto backup in Google drive .
kr.co.devstory.vocat,you need to know the korean name
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"it was good but words weren't that useful for life to know, not very many were interesting"
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"this is the best app to memorize, i memorized like 20 words in 1 week"
kr.co.devstory.vocat,This is one of those app you must appreciate in life. This is a Perfect App.
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"amazing app, best that I found on the internet for exactly flash cards learning + that is not the only way you can study, thanks (≧▽≦)"
kr.co.devstory.vocat,best of all
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"It's an amazing app, it has helped me a lot with my vocabulary studies & you can customize your vocabulary to your needs. It is free and you can choose from different revision methods. Just a little idea that would make it even better: I would welcome a feature to favor certain vocabulary groups!"
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"this is great application, i love this. but how to change the pronunciation language for whole vocab?"
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"Guys ,please try to ad Spaced Repetition Software system and It's gonna be the most powerful app(aesthetic😍✨)"
kr.co.devstory.vocat,can't thank enough... I've been trying to find this type of app for months..🤦
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"это реально лучшее приложение!! обожаю его,все очень удобно. подходит для изучения новых слов, мне он помогает чтобы улучшить уровень английского. разрабы,добавьте чтобы можно было делиться словарями, словамм🥺🥺."
kr.co.devstory.vocat,It’s an amazing app. You can just use it as a notebook and then it automatically makes flashcard and mcq for you. Really helpfull

kr.co.devstory.vocat,easy
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"This is honestly the best vocab app I’ve ever tried. Simple to use, and effective. It really helps me improve both my English and Korean."
kr.co.devstory.vocat,Very useful for studying my vocab.
kr.co.devstory.vocat,جيد جدا في ترتيب الكلمات والجمل وتخرينها، حتى البحث عنها في القاموس، وحتى اللعب الموجودة فيها تحسن من حفظها
kr.co.devstory.vocat,My device is Oppo A75 and this app won't even open.
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"Thinking about uninstalling and finding a different vocabulary app. It's all of sudden not syncing between devices. An error message of ""incompatible data"" keeps popping up and it's frustrating. Makes the app not user friendly. Please fix. This app has so much potential."
com.sololearn.ai,absolutely awesome!
com.sololearn.ai,the app has issues
com.sololearn.ai,worst app they couldnt have the leaves
com.sololearn.ai,"Nice app to learn... practical guidence and lessons in AI TOOLS (n8n,lovable, opensourse LLM) will be useful if added in this course..."
com.sololearn.ai,very beneficial app
com.sololearn.ai,"it's perfect application for Students, programers, an AI generalist for initial stages."
com.sololearn.ai,Advertised is misleading. It isn't free any other information is not necessary I do not suggest anyone download this app and assume that you're going to get something that you really don't have to pay for
com.sololearn.ai,Good
com.sololearn.ai,it only teaches me ai
com.sololearn.ai,Super helpful app to learn the fundamentals of AI and put it into practice
com.sololearn.ai,"Wow, great!!! it's good to use to learn"
com.sololearn.ai,It could better if you add advanced courses.
com.sololearn.ai,"Same app with less features…! What's the usability? I really like the Sololearn app and I've been using it for more than a year! It has great features and community support. This app is just excluding all coding courses and the community. This app doesn't even sync with Sololearn app! I've to create new account with same email here. So, it's useless at least for me."
com.jernung.infinite.fra,you should add the words with articles
com.jernung.infinite.fra,A joke.
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"Over all I enjoy the Infinite Language Apps, but I was surprised to see the word for ""pig"" taught as ""porc"" (pork) rather than ""cochon"" (pig). Are the word lists checked by native French speakers? Makes me wonder if the other words are accurate. I sure hope so."
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"This app is very helpful, I love it very easy to use and helps alot to practice french for me. Love it!"
com.jernung.infinite.fra,it's perfect
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Good but you can't really do anything unless you pay to unlock. Duolingo is better.
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"Oh, is it in ""beta""? No matter… it's Super Cool about buying it allows some more difficulty settings, but what I was hoping for; was to have some new words to try out… maybe even some phrases or something…? Anything, really. But, at least; the groundwork is pretty awesome as-is. …and if it actually really is in ""beta""? Then I certainly look forward to the finish of this very cool language-teaching game already!! 😊"
com.jernung.infinite.fra,it is fun to play and helps me now
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"enjoy all languages set with same words in same process, so good in linguistics observation."
com.jernung.infinite.fra,👍
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Freezes on launch. Help
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Amazing apps fr help u learn so fast 😍😍❤️
com.jernung.infinite.fra,very basic learning is free the rest is paid
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"not good,Duolingo is the best"
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"finally found a language game that's visual, cheap, doesn't require a monthly subscription. the visually based learning is a huge plus!!"
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Need more words
com.jernung.infinite.fra,best
com.jernung.infinite.fra,★⚪★★⚪★ nOOooOOOO why 2O in the f wor rD edit THANSK FOR THE LIKES
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Fantastic app. Great for drilling French basics. Would love to see the alphabet and more vocabulary added. Would also be happy to pay for those upgrades. Thanks!
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"It's extremely basic French, no masculine and feminine pronouns so it won't help you string sentences together. However, for what it's meant to be, it's a good app. Great for visualising and building a foundation of beginner words. If you're past the basics, this app isn't for you. But it was fun to play through!"
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Pretty good for beginners getting their fundamental vocabulary
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"J'amie cette application , facil et amusante ."
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Reasonably productive to teach multiple languages at one time. It Infinite has 10 language games teaching same words in same process and expands brain and individuals ability to learn. Multiple uses for this process of learning. No concern of age and the words can corrilate with other games and learning materials.
com.jernung.infinite.fra,it's so good and enjoy
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Mong ra nhiều từ vựng hơn
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Best way to learn French. It's very fun and entertaining
com.jernung.infinite.fra,love it
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Easy and fun!
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"Should really include articles with the words as it is really important to know the gender of the words to correctly write adjectives describing the nouns, other parts of speech and whole sentences later. To ignore it leaves out a lot of important information."
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"A nice fresh idea. It needs to have the articles/gender of words both on the word list, and also when the comets are falling."
com.hrd.vocabulary,it's fantastic
com.hrd.vocabulary,"if a word is a slang , atleast mention it in a bracket or something like that to let us know that it is a slang , jesus , such a silly mistake!!!"
com.hrd.vocabulary,Really fun and engaging way to learn some new words!
com.hrd.vocabulary,very helpful
com.hrd.vocabulary,"I discovered this amazing app through Pinterest, and it's definitely a great way to learn new words. I'm really enjoying using it, and I can see it becoming a regular part of my screen time."
com.hrd.vocabulary,"Remove the subscription if you can, because it is a deep ocean of the words."
com.hrd.vocabulary,they make you set up a profile on the assumption that it's free and after 10minutes of making the profile they tell you that you need to pay for a subscription
com.hrd.vocabulary,"it really helps with how you speak to he honest! it doesn't have any downsides, and even if you don't pay , you can still learn everything <3"
com.hrd.vocabulary,I've already seen words I've never seen before in this app 😮
com.hrd.vocabulary,I don't know about this aap but hope it's free for learning
com.hrd.vocabulary,this app definitely helps a lot
com.hrd.vocabulary,"easy to use, but free option is limited"
com.hrd.vocabulary,good
com.hrd.vocabulary,It's too much for an app. It helps me learn new words everyday and I can choose topic on which I want to learn today. App UI is so smooth and themes are good. Loving it 😁😍
com.hrd.vocabulary,love it
com.hrd.vocabulary,"listed as free, is not free"
com.hrd.vocabulary,It would be really good if the app was for free
com.hrd.vocabulary,Beneficial app for the new learners .. but It doesn't provide everything for free so that I can be more convenient for everyone to learn because in my opinion learning should be free for everyone...otherwise it's just a mere app not more than that because of not free btw.. this mere app is absolutely brilliant in way of learning and it can be more brilliant if it takes effort to make it purely free app..🤞🏻😅
com.hrd.vocabulary,"love the app, not so much the price not gonna lie"
com.hrd.vocabulary,teaches me
com.hrd.vocabulary,"While the app is great overall, free in both installation and to use, and ad free, it doesn't have an option to correct nor report when a definition is wrong. To 'relish' something is NOT to merely just ""enjoy it"". To 'relish' something, is to ""enjoy it IMMENSELY""."
com.hrd.vocabulary,It teaches you words but you have to pay
com.hrd.vocabulary,so cool 😎
com.hrd.vocabulary,it's very good app
com.hrd.vocabulary,"I have been using this app for almost a month now and most of the words that come across I don't fully know. The word today was "" Hemicycle. "" The definition was ""like"" a half circle. That may be a definition for the word but not the most accurate. Now I'm questioning other definitions I have read from this app."
com.hrd.vocabulary,I was interested until I realized its full of Ai and doesnt obviously disclose this.
com.hrd.vocabulary,I am just new in it so not that much opinions.....fr buttt itss funn in real
com.hrd.vocabulary,i really like the app.
com.hrd.vocabulary,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
com.hrd.vocabulary,Great game need more games like this🤗♥️
com.spotify.music,After 8 year I think it's time to say goodbye to Spotify because now it's very irritating after Spotify lite version
com.spotify.music,"The spectre of difficult logins into Spotify has returned from 2018. NEVER BUY Spotify Premium 1. App and Spotify web client are heavily bugged 2. If you type in Search ""Rock Music"", letters ck will type after the word Music 3. the music stops every two minutes and you can't enjoy Spotify Premium 4. Don't regret and don't waste money on this sham app by succumbing to its ""Buy Spotify Premium"" ad blitz 5. Moreover it's repertoire is not extensive as YT Music 6. Better buy YT Premium."
com.spotify.music,Too much adverts
com.spotify.music,it is gud I like rocks
com.spotify.music,🔥
com.spotify.music,Best ever got premium yay
com.spotify.music,this app is one of best apps for listening music such a shame the ads are GOSH there so many bruh I give 2 stars before it's 5 stars I hate the free version become so limited compare yt music free version 5 times better than this.SPOTIFY PLSSS LISTEN UR FEEDBACK AND COMMUNITY
com.spotify.music,puro ads. walang pera pang premium🥹
com.spotify.music,"Advertisements every now and then, after listening to two or three songs, it's really annoying. As per the saying, after listening to two or three ads, you can listen to music for half an hour in peace. But after no two or three songs, ads again. I've really lost faith in Spotify. I'll see if I can find another good app. I'll switch."
com.spotify.music,Good
com.spotify.music,Great for music
com.spotify.music,it is so bad app do not use this app 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
com.spotify.music,so well
com.spotify.music,amazing experience with app
com.spotify.music,worst app
com.spotify.music,"banyak banget iklan, harga juga naik"
com.spotify.music,good music 👍
com.spotify.music,Sampling Tidal Music because it offers De Niña a Mujer which I wish Spotify would carry by Grupo Pasion Musical. The Ink Spots' Address Unknown is a cleaner copy than Spotify has. I find too many holes in their library to justify switching. Spotify's music selections allow me to pick several tracks before doing a manual refresh. Tidal gives me a new list every time I pick just one. I'm sampling Tidal because they have a better version of De Niña a Mujer.
com.spotify.music,Easy access to types of music and reliable
com.spotify.music,i love it
com.spotify.music,حلو جداااا
com.spotify.music,"Unremovable annoying bar always shown in status bar, taking up precious space. Stop pushing useless features and finally fix the old bugs (like playback issues)."
com.spotify.music,one of the best apps
com.spotify.music,"I luv music but u hate it when the thing pops up where it says ""wanna explore spotify premium"" it's really annoying LIKE LET ME LISTEN TO MUSIC."
com.spotify.music,and I was pretty much I want to hear the library is awesome
com.spotify.music,just loving it 😍😍
com.spotify.music,"good music app, good to hear, good quality"

com.getmimo,"SCAM took my money to upgrade to 250 messages costing £44.49, didn't allow me to then use the app or messages. * update*fixed the issue after 5 days of nothing and being directed through basic steps which never worked. again a month later my subscription is due to renew and low and behold, my money has been taken and my subscription hasn't refreshed. went through their steps again and nothing. now to wait god knows how long to get a resolution again. update again, cancelled my subscription"

com.getmimo,best for beginners 😉 so good app
com.getmimo,thank you for the support
com.getmimo,"it's actually really fun and intuitive, it's basically just Duolingo for coding! I also love that it doesn't use AI at all and and the ads are very minimal."
com.getmimo,"After 1-1.5 hours of use, I find it a nice coding intro. The auto-fill/correction is too small, leading to frequent clicks and more accidental deletions than desired. I'll update in a week on its performance."
com.getmimo,very easy lives are a bit annoying at first but I think it will be worth paying for
com.getmimo,"great choice of exercises. questions get gradually harder and covers the topic well enough so the users feel confident. couple of suggestions though - when minimised, partially solved tests are refreshed very quickly and your progress is lost. there should be savepoints in exercises - there should be an indicator to show how many questions are in the test - there really should be an offline mode!!! cant use the app if you're not connected as it is."
com.getmimo,it is great just ads and 1 it made me stick on 1 level but it is ok😊
com.getmimo,"I'm not here to tell you that Ads are annoying, rather than, the lesson is so boring. There is too many levels for a single, easy and silly topic. And the editor is not so good for an intermediate learner. You need to upgrade leveling as who just wants learn good CSS, will be bored soon."
com.getmimo,"It's a fun way to learn so far but I'm not sure about the courses. There are not enough available courses, eg. for someone who wants to go into cyber security."
com.getmimo,fun way to code.
com.getmimo,very good 😊😊 it's easy to understand as a beginner
com.getmimo,where is main programming languages JAVA & KOTLIN.
com.getmimo,im learning a lot thanks
com.getmimo,"Predatory app that encourages you to spend money. Using hearts after running out mid-lesson glitches the UI so that you are forced to close the app and restart the lesson from the beginning...no progress saved, and you just wasted 200 coins. Uninstalling because this was not a one time issue and I've probably wasted about 2000 coins because of this glitch. Not to mention the lessons after the first few modules are not built in a way that helps you learn."
com.getmimo,you should start from the very top how can you teach someone without explaining what they are doing you didn't start with the creation of the html or the body tag you just started with h1 this em that
com.getmimo,"Mimo is a great app for beginners who are just getting into coding. It explains concepts in a simple way, uses short lessons that are easy to follow, and lets you practice by typing real code, which builds confidence fast. It’s especially good on mobile, though it doesn’t go very deep and some content is locked behind payment, so it’s best used as a starting point alongside other resources. Overall, It's the best app."
com.getmimo,very nice
com.getmimo,"This is the best app I have ever used for learning coding, It's just like Duolingo. That's amazing."
com.getmimo,"I'm an AI student. After using it, I can say that it really helped a lot. This app is good for beginners (help in basic concept nicely). since I'm at beginner level so let's see how it will help in core concepts."
com.getmimo,lovely app
com.getmimo,2nd day doing it.. So far it is good.. Can't make a decision until I've used it for longer..
com.getmimo,"wow, it's fun and very helpful"
com.getmimo,I am loving and enjoying it.
com.getmimo,"great, simple and useful"
com.getmimo,app is going well for me. But I don't know how to navigate the practicals
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"En clair, l'application est bonne, même très bonne."
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,really laggy
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,good
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,it's nice but I don't have money for premium sooo
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,عالی و ساده
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,thank you
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"Great for learning languages at your own pace! I love how fun it is and how it's so interactive. I would've gave this 5 stars, but the only negative comments I have is that there isn't many options for categories upon first opening the app, and that it doesn't clearly teach you the words, the only way I can describe it is as a study and test system, which can be useful for memorizing words, but not so much learning new things as effectively as you could be."
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"really good app for beginners, no gimmicks, just repetition repetition repetition. it works."
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,really good foundations
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,good boy.......
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,it easy to learn for beginners
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,I am now in the France and I am a indian
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,it mostly teaches you mostly how to spell and write it so I'll recommend it to people learning how to spell. But it's really good!
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,perfect for beginners
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,This is very good
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,appreciate
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,It cannot offline anymore.
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,very good
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"Good app, better than Duolingo in my opinion. Is very direct in teaching the language rather than trying to make you spend more time on the app."
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,Please add Khmer to this French learning app. Thank you. Good luck. I like this app.
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,is very easy app to learn french
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,i love this educational tools for learning French language but I have Aphasia so I need to repeat and know if I already understand it.
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"Pratico, intuitivo, non necessariamente a pagamento consente di studiare e testare ciò che si è appreso"
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"je aime cette app je aprende beaucoup, je remercie. i only gave 4 because I downloaded recently and then I'm using only now"
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,good
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,Very nice for beginners
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,I like the audios but can't open anything else except the first four lessons
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,good
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"very nice app, better than Duolingo"
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,THE BEST APP

air.com.starfall.more,Very annoying that this does support family library. My daughter can't have full access on her own google acct on her tablet bc she's a minor which you can't create account/subscribe for full access on her google account and her account is family linked to mine for subscriptions to be approved through me. You need reconsider and utilize family library.
com.quillbot.mobile,this app is the worst app that have ever tried it travels me so much for one hour
com.quillbot.mobile,"I would like to subscribe to Premium. Can you please clarify the limitations of the 'Humanize' feature? Specifically, how many words can I process at once, and is the total limit per month 25000, meaning if I use 25k in a day, then it's off?"
com.quillbot.mobile,❌researchers stay away Not good for academics and research. I used it showing 0% AI for the content but Turnitin qualified it as 99% AI written content. humanizer is not able to humanize properly. I wasted my money and had to buy another humanizer.
com.quillbot.mobile,"I can't live without this app now, but I'd like an extra-large keyboard layout."
com.quillbot.mobile,when did i downloaded this?
com.quillbot.mobile,Excellent! I'm good with it.
com.quillbot.mobile,incredible
com.quillbot.mobile,the most unreliable ai detector
com.quillbot.mobile,l cancel the subscription on the last day of the month but they already charged me a full quarter. They NEVER reply my messages.
com.quillbot.mobile,very perfect helpful ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
com.quillbot.mobile,not free
com.quillbot.mobile,totally awesome
com.quillbot.mobile,It's annoying when always pop-up for recommendations during typing
com.quillbot.mobile,premium
com.quillbot.mobile,It is very useful and helpful
com.quillbot.mobile,I do not write anything without going through quill bot first
com.quillbot.mobile,"One of the best app for students and writers. Helps me write my assignments, my reports. I also took it's help to fix all my grammatical errors of my novel."
com.quillbot.mobile,Worst experience
com.quillbot.mobile,"When I wrote my first Book ""Me And My Pen"" it was so helpful for me."
com.quillbot.mobile,"I signed up for a one month subscrition on Quill bot and they charged me for one YEAR. I have emailed them several times asking for a refund, however, they continue to ignore me. Today I will have to file a dispute with my bank to get my money back. This company is obviously not reputable!"
com.quillbot.mobile,"perfect , helpful and easy to use....."
com.quillbot.mobile,it's good and this app recommended by my classmate and my English teacher so I want to try to use it too.
com.quillbot.mobile,"I paid for subscriptions hoping to have a one-click experience with the paraphrasing tool, but after paraphrasing, repeatedly humanizing, and copying out the output, the AI detector tool still says the output is a hundred percent AI generated. I can't find any useful applications for the service after spending my hard-earned money, and the editor is consistently slow and unresponsive."
com.quillbot.mobile,"I love using QuillBot; it is like advanced Grammarly. But the auto-suggest and auto-correct need more work, please."
com.quillbot.mobile,the features I required they are in paid section how am I supposed to even see the difference if I have to pay to check the features.
com.quillbot.mobile,fantastic app
com.quillbot.mobile,better
com.quillbot.mobile,"""Unpacking the best experience"" for 2 days already, still did not unpacked 😁"
com.quillbot.mobile,helpful
com.quillbot.mobile,The grammar check hasn't been working for almost 2 days now. fix it
com.guidedelearning.flex,"Quite good, but can you please add a highlighting feature in reading and listening? Also, add additional features that allow access to more mock tests (besides the original 25 mock tests) by paying a certain amount of money?"
com.guidedelearning.flex,"The one-star rating is simply because of a major bug in the app. When I am taking an exercise and I select an answer, I can't scroll down to the other things that I should be answering 😔 PLEASE FIX IT ASAP ⚠️"
com.guidedelearning.flex,"this is the worst scam i have ever seen. do not spend a fraction of your money on their useless ai as it gives misinformation and an unclear assesment of your writings. even chatgpt is better although it isnt trained on ielts. what a load of bull. all they want is to grab your money (no refunds btw) just to tell you to write ""better"""
com.guidedelearning.flex,Great app for learning
com.guidedelearning.flex,I can't open the app
com.guidedelearning.flex,"good, I bit of confusion with the courses need some UX improvements"
com.guidedelearning.flex,Good for IELTS perperation.
com.guidedelearning.flex,I don't believe in the AI generated band score.
com.guidedelearning.flex,Absolutely helpful. No other preparation materials needed.
com.guidedelearning.flex,Best app to studying IELTS but the price is too high for result check.
com.guidedelearning.flex,The app is so slow. The videos take too much time to load. It's annoying!
com.guidedelearning.flex,"when there is a word select list in some exercise, as soon as one of the lists is clicked, the scrolling stops, which means you can't scroll to the next word"
com.guidedelearning.flex,😎
com.guidedelearning.flex,Good
com.guidedelearning.flex,Worst app! Though they have partnered with British council to provide mock tests but you can't do it because of bugs in app as you can't scroll down to watch question and time keeps flying.
com.guidedelearning.flex,The user experience is topnotch
com.guidedelearning.flex,Need to pay just to practice listening
com.guidedelearning.flex,"Really helpful, my IELTS result exceeded my expectations. Listening and reading mock tests are kinda harder than the actual test in my opinion. The format is different from the actual computer based test, i would say the actual test format is way more convenient and easier to use than Flex especially for reading tests. But overall i think it still worth your money with many videos about 4 skills and zoom classes. I've never tried AI writing and speaking test feedbacks but they are included."
com.guidedelearning.flex,Half of functions are not available 😒
com.guidedelearning.flex,"The app keeps freezing, it keeps saying error and then kicks you out, I took a paid subscription to use the AI component and couldn't even use it because it keeps throwing out an error"
com.db.lingotv,Eliki kyejo
com.db.lingotv,"I need a account recovery button, and google sign in option."
com.db.lingotv,"I was instantly hooked on this app after trying it, my Japanese became so much smoother and more confident. But the app doesn't really work. I got the voice recognition to pick up my voice once... And then it never worked again. Restarted app, phone, and reinstalled. Nothing worked :( sad I have to delete, I was thinking of buying a yearly plan."
com.db.lingotv,Nice
com.db.lingotv,good app
com.db.lingotv,"This app is super useful with its amazing and outstanding Aoi AI tutor. Compare to other AI tutor, it stands out. As an N3-level learner, I think it's the best learning tool I've ever used."
com.db.lingotv,Good app. But could you help me to recover my password? I forgot password and don't know how to re-inlog again
com.db.lingotv,Like
com.db.lingotv,Amazing but I wish there were no money spending included 😔
com.db.lingotv,Horrible
com.db.lingotv,"This app is not working well at all. I can't hear the other person, or the conversation lags. It has only been a couple days. Can I get a refund?"
com.db.lingotv,I can not reset my practice of my account. I want to practice repeat and repeat.How to restart practice in my account.
com.db.lingotv,very good
com.db.lingotv,a good one Aoi but my Japanese speaking is not perfect but soo nice talking to her🤫 わたしはすきです
com.db.lingotv,"Vraiment super concept. Beaucoup plus de scénario/situations disponibles que je pensais et plusieurs autres modes disponibles. Par contre, après que la première conversation avec l'IA soit finie, on ne peut plus continuer sans payer, même le lendemain. C'est dommage, il faudrait laisser le choix à ceux qui peuvent payer de payer pour continuer à utiliser l'appli et ceux qui ne peuvent pas, d'attendre le lendemain. Du coup, je désinstalle."
com.db.lingotv,Wonderful app
com.db.lingotv,this app is crazy 🔥
com.db.lingotv,ずれはエピピ良いし わたしはすきです。
com.db.lingotv,"Je suis allée voir cette application juste pour essayer, et j'ai été vraiment convaincue par l'échange en japonais que j'ai pu avoir avec l'IA Aoi. Je vais tester à plusieurs reprises encore, avant de passer à la version payante. En tous cas, cette app. peut être une solution pour des apprenants qui bloquent sur l'oral en japonais, ce qui est très fréquent."
com.db.lingotv,"Can't find any next bottom in the ""choose at lest 3 "" Idk Developer please fix it I need this app so much"
com.db.lingotv,I'm actually a huge fan of this app
com.db.lingotv,"Extremely buggy for such a pricy subscription. The app stops recognising the voice in the middle of practice until I restart it. Sometimes it's just the users's pich accent line that disappeares. The AI is not tuned to teach grammar or define words with example sentences and other features. All in all , great Idea but poor implementation . Btw, lessons results are always in Chinese."
com.db.lingotv,Voice recognition works very badly after recent update. Please fix it asap!
com.db.lingotv,"Actually pretty good, rather a bit expensive it seems, I think there can be more to improve, not having AI pictures or just any picture in general or be able to pick a picture would be less awkward. It has very nice suggestions, it would be nice if there was a toggle for furigana for Kanji or for certain Kanji past certain levels for the ones the user doesn't know yet. The UI can be a little better too, needs some work and some dark mode would be nice."
com.db.lingotv,The app itself is really good and helpful when it actually opens so the reason it is only 3 stars is for the fact it won't open so and I have good wifi and it won't open I have let it load for the past 20 minutes and it hasn't loaded and I tried restarting the app and it still won't work so it is currently redownloading I will change my rating if this issue becomes resolved. Thank you!
com.db.lingotv,This app really help me learning jpn language and improving my speaking skill except for the chat power that ran out before I knew it.
com.db.lingotv,"I can't even sign into the app, at the second step it just stops"
com.db.lingotv,There is a sound of pronunciation Formal and informal conversations in various places Very great
com.db.lingotv,ok
com.db.lingotv,A very good learning tool that teaches pronunciation and pitch very cleverly. Also the vocabulary used is functional and useful for tasks that learners will need to know on a daily basis. Overall very impressive.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,Not worth downloading if you're not willing to pay. Might as well be a paid app.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"i like this game, although I wish there were more ads to watch even at the expense of energy you get for them (like infinite ads for 20 energy), since premium is kinda too expensive for me. Also I don't know if this'll change later but what we learn in the beginning is kinda random."
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,fun
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I'm having a fun time learning a new language! The rpg element is fun and keeps me wanting to play more!
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,Wonderful app! Makes learning fun 😊
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I love this game!! got my brother to do it with me and he loves it! I posted on bsky! it's working so well for me.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,Fun way to learn. I'm studying french and this helps a lot.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,fun so far. interested to see where it take my language skills
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"love the adventure theme to learning a language. after 1 day, I've done farming and battled some bad guys while learning Spanish!"
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,it's a great learning app but the language options leave much to be desired. Would love Scandinavian options and maybe Tagalog
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"I've been playing daily for almost a year. Lifetime premium access seemed worth it but they added paid currency packs shortly after I joined. Recently they nerfed part of the in-game player economy gains, and it was already a grind to progress so it's starting to feel like it asks for a lot of your time or money. It's hard to get all the seasonal rewards if you don't play for hours a day. I like the game, but it incentivizes grinding easy flashcards for rewards instead of learning new things."
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I tried to download the app and the curriculum never loaded. I waited up to 5 minutes. I could never get past the let's begin phase. I was connected to the internet and I tried clearing cash clearing data and restarting my phone. nothing worked.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"Why do I have to fight? On top of that, there's no way to end it if you are not into combat."
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,love the option between farming and fighting. im really into learning thanks to this 😍
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"what a great way to learn languages. despite it not seeming like a lot, learning languages through games is an amazing feature and can often help others a lot more than educational settings such as lessons or classrooms. the games are fun, engaging, and what an easy app to use! only giving it 4 stars because of their lack of languages. i settled for latin american spanish but i really wanted to see norwegian or some swedish."
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I love how rewarding but also not restrictive this game is
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,for the past 6 months I've been using this to learn spanish. its been great. I'm talking with my customers in spanish!
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,this is an awesome way to learn a language. it feels like a game.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I don't like this game that much because you have to sign into your account and then you have to subscribe to just play the game 😔😔
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"Very fun and cute! reminds me of Prodigy, but the learning is less obtrusive in this game. so its easier to want to keep playing :)"
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"haven't played it, it didn't have my language I want to practice! I would love to see Ukrainian on here! will try out if it ever comes!"
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,fun and you really start learning immediately if you are a beginner. I was going to try it out in intermediate in another language as well. you can switch between different languages and skill levels. seems neat so far.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"this game is very fun, i love the medieval-like music and i'm learning useful words that other apps just don't or do it after a year you used them, I also like that you learn some words without having to force yourself too much because of the lil games, I LOVE THIS GAME!!"
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"Premium is not at all necessary, and the game play is engaging. Having a farming mode and fighting mode so most everyone should be happy. It has many languages and dilects too."
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"Edited from 5* to 4* because I bought premium and already finished the combat story path in two weeks 😭 .. I just started playing today and this game is REALLY fun and effective. The music is good and the animations are cute. It gives you a choice to do farming or combat. I'm a combat girl. The card combat is really fun with good cards to build a deck with so far. For language learning, I'm REALLY enjoying it so far. It has flash cards and words are voiced, and it's repetitive enough to get it!"
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,its genuinely a really fun way to learn a language
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,Very fun and engaging in learning a new language :)
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,Just started and I do enjoy the cards and getting to go through them as often as I like. But the actual game play is tedious and so far has absolutely nothing to do with the language I'm trying to learn. Maybe if the characters used the words and phrases it would make more sense. I'm on the non pay version so I don't know if language immersion is part of the premium. I just don't see the point of the farm and adventures when they so far have zero to do with learning a language.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I love how you don't have to buy something to do more
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,This game is great! I have had a hard time finding an app which would give me enough content to learn anything new but this game gives you plenty of free content while making it fun. you don't have to buy anything and it has helped me with grammatical things in certain languages I couldn't quite get until now.
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,very useful and easy for learning
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,good exercise
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"It is a good app, but there are so many mistakes in it."
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"not bad but tons of spelling errors. for example, it's mission impossible, not mission imposible. Proof reading would be ideal."
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"Too many errors to use this app for learning English. Here are some examples:   ""I need an help with my homework."" (should be: ""I need help with my homework."") ""An used phone."" (should be: ""A used phone."")"
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"I would have given this app five stars if it wasn't for the ridiculous amount of ads. Show me an ad after three exercises/topics or so, not two ads after every single exercise."
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,good app
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,I don't know the reason why this app is not famous that much..but I am learned a lot by this app...thanks to this I am gonna crush and rock in next exam..

com.milinix.englishgrammartest,Good tests!
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,Has some typos other than that it's very good.
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"The material is good, but there are a few statements that need correction to avoid possible confusion or misinformation among learners."
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,The app is really very good . But we can't find exactly what we want.
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,I like the application
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,helpful
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"I have no idea who created this app, but one of the explanations doesn't make any sense. When I answered ""the party was boring,"" the answer key said that the correct answer was ""the party was bore."" The explanation even mentioned ""a bored party."""
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,it's best for child
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"This app has a lot of potential and it is good. However, they are too many instances where either the explanations do not make sense, or answers are marked as mistakes when they should not be (ex: ""You must to come to my party"" is apparently correct). I have little to no complaint for the lessons, they are great, but when it comes to the exercise they are too many instances where I doubt the answers."
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,good app and very helpful
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,It is a very complete app but it has some errors in the answers.
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"Great app for English language,If you want everything in one place, like confusing words, grammar topics,and each topic of this language then everything is in this app, I have completed all the tests and learning in 5 months. extremely easy to use,well-designed app. Love from India 🇮🇳 keep going god bless you 🌸"
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,simple

com.eup.migiitoeic,Thank you for creating this such wonderful app ever. morever i did study a lot of stuff and also understand more about toeic. Thanks.
com.eup.migiitoeic,Nice
com.eup.migiitoeic,第一次留app評論就給你們了 看到網路上的英文老師推薦，就買了永久的會員，還不便宜，沒想到竟然練習的模擬試題詳解都無法看。 有寫信回報，來回了兩三封信之後就音訊全無，我還很配合，需要錄影、截圖傳給你們看我這邊看到的狀況的我都傳了，然後就沒有消息了，好歹也要告訴我你們有在處理，需要一點時間，不然我怎麼知道你們有沒有收到，有沒有在處理？ 今天看到更新，我重新試了一遍，整個模擬試題只有part1.2可以看到詳解，其他的依然看不到。 另外有一些每日練習題也會沒有詳解！！ 不是標榜會員能看詳解嗎？結果詳解都不能看...那我花這個錢買你們的app作用何在？ 我的第一封信是5/14傳的，至今已過了超過兩週的時間，依然無法解決問題。
com.eup.migiitoeic,"Very Good And Fun application to learning English, and quite closed to Toeic test! unfortunately there's premium price that so Expensive!"

com.grammarly.android.keyboard,it's very good for its use I really like it
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,too much. was better when it was just a keyboard.
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,Very Good
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"Generally, it is helpful. Sometimes it can be distracting. I use other AI tools that are more robust for formal writing, but for texts and comments on social media, Grammarly helps with punctuation and grammar until the free version stops working. ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot are better suited for larger projects, while Grammarly is generally well-suited for informal writing."
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,Very good experience. Thanks grammarly
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,It really made a big difference for me.
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,The best app i ever use.It helps me lot.I highly recommend this app.
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"It functions exceptionally well. I appreciate its use because it enhances the clarity of my text messages. However, my sole concern is that it repeatedly switches off. I re-enable it, only to find it deactivates again when I need to use it. This issue is becoming increasingly frustrating."
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,Great investment.
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,Excellent. Highly recommend.
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,It's very helpful to correct the English grammar
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,cool
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,If free service is provided it's the best app on Play Store.
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,is really helpful
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"A pleasant surprise every time it is given permission to help you. Definitely a top-rated app. Developer - I have noticed the floating widget sometimes gets lost, deserting me. That's very unfortunate. — If the floating widget can elude you. In that case, open the phone settings>notifications then scroll to Grammarly. Toggle it OFF then ON to give it a wake-up nudge😉"
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,I've experienced perfection at it's peak. I've seen the light that AI brings to the table. It is therefore undefeated in the concept of accurate knowledge. I therefore recant my recent suspicion of AI and its companion apps.
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,Exceptional
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,it helps

livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,"What an excellent dictionary. The application works with the smaller screen of my older phone. As a learner, I use history a lot. The text-to-speech pronunciation seems reliable."
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,LOVE It!
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,Merci pour ce dictionnaire.🙌🏼🙏🏼
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,it's the best one . I've been using it for more than 7 years

livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,good
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,"I hope the developers see this. The audio feature is not working on mine. I have tried re-installing but it's still same. I also use the English counterpart which works perfectly, but this French version is not giving me audio. I'd appreciate any guidance, please. I'm looking forward to a solution, SVP. Thank you. Otherwise, je t'aime bien l'application. C'est utile !"
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,easy to use and no advertisement app
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,Il est là. Thank you very much for this app.
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,Great !
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,I feel downloading all language when you supposed to have them already on the so the only thing left will just to update is data consuming. it supposed to be as you download the app it has all the languages downloaded with it not that I'll download English then waste my data to download french because there's a french word the the English version is reading out wrongly.
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,This application is very helpful.
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,"simple à utiliser et très pratique, je le recommande pas plutôt je l'oblige à tous."
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,"Excellent, use all the time. I like the etymologies & the IPA pronunciations are especially useful as you can see alternatives to the Audio pronunciation (top left speaker symbol). Good Search, History, Notes. Did you know you can do wild card searches? Use ? symbol for the missing letters when playing SUTOM."
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,excellent 👌
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,I can't update something stupid.
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,Meilleure application pour s'enrichir en vocabulaire... Gratitude aux co-créateurs d'application....

fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,lesson voice is not working
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,A very wonderful app for learning French.
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,"outstanding way to learn french, very impressive"
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Never buy this app. They tie you to pay for it for 2 years without the right to resign. it's absolutely not worth it.
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,great app
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,very fun and interactive but I need to be able to see my friends score as well or talk to people online
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,This app makes learning French fun and understandable!
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,C'est bien
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,not sure
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,"для тех, кто замучился изучать французский, тема рабочая 😅👌"

fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,An excellent text for jss
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,You gave no time to try?
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,"You really have to know at least some French just to navagate your way through the app. Serously, what's the point of that? Really disappointing. .....I'll pass"
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,I've learned so much from this than Duolingo
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,When it's le monde - it sure is high end
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Good
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,great
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Wirklich eine sehr interessante App. sie ist aber noch sehr unausgereift teilweise sehr chaotisch von der Handhabung das darf bei dem Preis nicht sein da muss investiert werden. der Preis ist dadurch nicht gerechtfertigt und schon fast eine Frechheit. ich bin mir allerdings sicher dass es ein sehr komplexes Produkt ist und schwer zu verwirklichen ist. Trotzdem hut ab an all die Beteiligten Lehrer die Lehrinhalte sind doch was besonderes sehr gut sogar. nur eben Haptik und Preis passen nicht.
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,"Not a bad French learning app, reading and writing is straightforward to get to grips with and also added help when needed. The only snag is the ending, when I get round to speaking is, there is no help to reply to conversations. How do I reply to the speaking audio?"
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Fraternité Liberté Égalité.. c'est la vie! Vive la France ❤️💜
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,j'aime apprendre le français avec les cours de Le Monde. it is highly recommend. thank you
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Didn't specify that's it's a paid app
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,They force you to sign up in order for you to use the app. You cannot see the learning content without signing up first.
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,good
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,"Why anyone would want to spend insane amounts of money on this I can't fathom. Doesn't let you progress as you like. At most one 10 minutes lesson per day. The lessons are not particularly engaging, as far as I can judge from the free testing."
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,The content is fun and interesting but the ui is poorly designed and the learning is not flexible at all. And finally its way overpriced. I really cant see how you can expect someone to pay 20 times the price of duolingo or six times the price of pimsleur. The price they ask is offensive to say the least.
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Worst app
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,it's super
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Perfect app....i love it

ai.szl.mobileapp,very good especially in biology
ai.szl.mobileapp,it would be nice to have more preview courses options
ai.szl.mobileapp,I can boldly say this is a very superb educational app. I've even started recommending it to my friends. Easy to use and understand. Just give it a try.

com.languagedrops.drops.international,"I only installed to look for Arapaho Language but it's not on here, we still exist people!! Yes we went from being 100% pop. to less than 2% in the USA but we are not extinct yet."
com.languagedrops.drops.international,do not like this app at all. I do not want to have to sign up to pay for a subscription without being sure of the app first and I am not comfortable giving out my payment information until I'm sure I want to subscribe. it's a rip off.
com.languagedrops.drops.international,Learn language like a toddler. Perfect.
com.languagedrops.drops.international,this is so fun 😊 am enjoying myself
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"Waste of time unless you are an absolute beginner. Set it to start and intermediate and it is starting with the very very basics. like the words the or and or but and basic family members and other things that I learned many years ago. Apparently no way to skip over that and no way to speed it up. Tremendously frustrating and a huge waste of time. Thought perhaps paying for premium would resolve that but it did not. UPDATE: Support said language level doesn't change word difficulty, so useless"
com.languagedrops.drops.international,it really helps me alot.i learn faster in this app.highly recommended app for language lessons.
com.languagedrops.drops.international,I love this and it's very interesting easy to learn ❤️❤️ just the subscription..I wish it's free
com.languagedrops.drops.international,i like it
com.languagedrops.drops.international,super good fast learning.
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"this app is the best I have seen and also real, I've learnt a lot in just 2days. I recommend"
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"This is really an awesome app! Very helpful,and understanding clearly."
com.languagedrops.drops.international,Love the interactive nature of this app for learning words
com.languagedrops.drops.international,It's actually a really good app. It hypes you up and also makes learning easy 🌹👍🙃.
com.languagedrops.drops.international,excellent
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"I've been using this app for a year, and I'm very happy with this app, however I've noticed it's been too slow, as it freezes constantly for the last few months and I don't know if it needs updating or if there's some kind of error, I don't know, but it's annoying and I don't know if this is only happening to me or to someone else, but I hope there's a solution."
com.languagedrops.drops.international,good enough for new arabic learners
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"so good, not complicated and not too rush, basically focusing on mastering vocab which the core of the learning language"
com.languagedrops.drops.international,Fun and repetitive enough to stick on your brain yet keep you motivated.
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"Good. I love how it's easy to focus and not get distracted. One thing, I dislike how there is a limited time of lessons. I have so much time, yet they time it. Overall, amazing!"
com.languagedrops.drops.international,Very good
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"Use Duolingo, it's more better! I'm a premium user of the Drops, and performance is unacceptable. App is great and really help me study English, but, the performance is very poor, and application regularly hangs and lags when I use it. For the team: please improve the performance and do some refactoring, application isn't useful at all! I also don't like any animation, and it's completely disable on the system level, but the application is unfortunately use it, and it's a mistake."
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"There are pop-ups every 5 seconds. I don't want to do your app challenges unless I go to the menu to do them. I don't want to buy premium unless I go to the menu to do it. I do not want to see about New Year's resolutions unless I go to the menu to do it. Let me do the vocabulary, quit getting in my way."
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"Just downloaded and used the app fee minutes ago,and I'm loving it already. looking forward to my next session"
com.languagedrops.drops.international,very relaxing and easy to use
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"CRASH on startup, Android 10. Another category scramble, ok. Less cheerleading, better than too much. Smaller Ui fonts are too small, poor contrast, can't read on phone. Need toggle to hide English transliterated subtitles. Does NOT teach the words in a phrase before the phrase, so harder to learn. Never adapts to fast learners. Has excellent audio tests! Also see their scripts app for very necessary lessons on reading handwritten papers."
com.languagedrops.drops.international,I learned a lot but this app is very very expensive but yes this app is still good for learning new language
com.languagedrops.drops.international,A very good app to learn a language easily.
com.languagedrops.drops.international,good
com.languagedrops.drops.international,Use this and Pimsleur and you'll win!!
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"doesn't recognize speech, even with a Portuguese person trying"
com.wlingua.curso,"The app is more than wonderful, but the worst thing is that it doesn't have Arabic. I want to learn English or any language in Arabic because there are 22 countries where Arabic is spoken. I'm waiting for the update when Arabic is added. 😍💗💗💗"

com.wlingua.curso,this app so good but don't include Arabic language so I hope to add it as soon as possible add it as a native Arabic speaker for the users

com.knudge.me,this is the worst app .. because it doesn't unlock the new words..I wasted my money on it
com.knudge.me,I love this app. Because their method are unique.
com.knudge.me,Learning with this app is delectable. You deserve 10 stars out of 5.
com.knudge.me,"Hi, it works for me if the word has pictures to illustrate it. I really love it, please, if all of the words have pictures I will give 5 stars!"
com.knudge.me,"This is a wonderful application, definitely made by some geniuses... An improvement in it can be more helpful to the learners and that is, as there on the top of the page on the word card the thorough meaning is already mentioned below the word on top, so it could be the best one if there may be some explanatory detailed meaning in the meaning section which may help them who could not understand it properly only with the help of thorough meaning on top. Rest all is the best."
com.knudge.me,Good app loving it
com.knudge.me,parts of the screen are covered up buy on screen buttons such as III O V
com.knudge.me,repetitive
com.knudge.me,Exceptional!!! ✴️
com.knudge.me,it's very helpful I learned more new vocabularies which gave me confidence
com.knudge.me,the UI overlaps the phone buttons on screen. how can any one navigate of the star button overlaps the home button of the phone. i don't understand what the developers are thinking before placing it so close.
com.knudge.me,This app is consistently improving my abilities.
com.knudge.me,Best app I've ever used in any context.
com.knudge.me,"They took away my lifetime pro membership, and again want me to pay for pro membership."
com.knudge.me,best app out there for vocab. Fast and simple. some of the infographics are ingenious. well done!
com.knudge.me,"The best app to learn new words with an interactive method, and spending multiple activities just to learn a single word is helpful. find"
com.knudge.me,Best app
com.knudge.me,"the most beautiful thing that I like about the apps is their UI, and the graphics shown with the flashcards, these graphics are very relevant to the word"
com.knudge.me,best app
com.knudge.me,best👍
com.knudge.me,"please help, i've been download and purchasing for lifetime, then the app error conection and need to upgrade pro again"
com.knudge.me,"This seems unfair, I had paid for a lifetime subscription because this app was offering so many good things and not only vocabulary. there used to be a quiz, tenses and grammar lessons, now this has very basic information."
com.knudge.me,"would be better if i could get more credits nd more credits to use per day and get more cards, still an amazing app , a solid 9/10"
com.knudge.me,i like it
com.knudge.me,I have been there since the launch of the app. What happened to you? You were such a great app. People loved you. Where did you go? Why did you stop posting content in the app?
com.knudge.me,"Amazing, everything in one single app, vocabulary, practice, any what you want to learn words and meaning, everyday, I recommend this."
com.knudge.me,I am always bored to learn English but the Knudge app is so interesting that it helps me a lot highly recommended 🙂
com.jobsaround.verbs,"Really enjoying this app. Has audio, very useful grammar section, gives synonyms, has flashcard option, well structured layout, easy to navigate, shows french levels ( A1,A2 etc) No ads. Great for all learners of french!"

com.jobsaround.verbs,"This is a beautiful language learning app! Kudos to the developer for such a great job. I'm learning French and I found this app very useful for my French language learning journey! If you found this line very interesting, don't hesitate to download! I have no connection with the developer... And it is not a paid endorsement script... Just a clear, simple recommendation because it's really a nice app. I live very far, greetings to you from Monrovia-Liberia 🇱🇷"

com.french.zeemish,perfect app for easy learning
com.french.zeemish,very good
com.french.zeemish,everything I need is in this single app you guys deserve more than five stars ratings ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
com.french.zeemish,wonderful
com.french.zeemish,This app and all the others created by the editor are top-notch. They are just like Duolingo accessed offline.
com.french.zeemish,"bad if only there was 0.9, because I have to wait to play again if ......"

com.french.zeemish,justtt wowww
com.french.zeemish,good
com.french.zeemish,From day one I love this app but I miuse the opportunity of learning free at my space I had it for like 3 years on my phone and now I logged in today I realized it about money now but notwithstanding I still love everything about it.
com.french.zeemish,good app
com.french.zeemish,Great
com.french.zeemish,"excellent application, super platform to enhance our knowledge"
com.french.zeemish,C'est une application géniale
com.french.zeemish,nice
com.french.zeemish,Okay my only gripe about this game is I think if you are good at tests then you are not really learning on here. I don't think this is really teaching me I am just passing the tests. I thought at first once I ran out of hearts that was it. But watching two ads is not the worse to get another heart. I think you should try to keep people on this app as long as you can. But take a page from Netflix and charge $7 per month for gold and not $24 per month.
com.french.zeemish,Is a good idea
com.french.zeemish,wow🥰🥰🥰🥰
com.french.zeemish,so fantastic words are well pronounce and as a beginner can learn fast and where I am the done used credit card we use mobile money
com.french.zeemish,this is so incredibly I love it
com.french.zeemish,good
com.french.zeemish,Greater for understanding deep pronouncing of words
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,best for struggling learners and really helps u understand
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"great app, when I'm an adult and have my own money I'll consider getting a subscription. the daily lesson is nice. what you do is incredible, the variety is huge. just please add Yakut/Sakha language? there are no apps that teach it 😞😞😞"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"My absolute favorite language learning app. The lessons make the words easy to understand and memorize. Never before have I enjoyed trying a new language, especially Turkmen, which I struggled with prior."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,this app very useful
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"This is the best, by far, language learning app that I have ever used."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,c'est utile pour les débutants comme moi
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,this is an excellent app to learn what your saying in a new app
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I love this app. I can learn multiple languages at the same time. It's free but if you want to learn more then you have to buy it. I'm learning Algerian darija which is just a dialect and it is so challenging to find an app to learn it but BlueBird has made it easy for me. I've learned so many useful words and phrases from BlueBird. Thank you!
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"Fuer einfache Konversation ist die App optimal.Wer aber eine Sprache fluessig sprechen willl ,kommt auch mit dieser App nicht weit."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I love it it's so easy to learn with it but its missing languages I need to learn like tongan and maori or other pacific languages other wise it would of been a 5 stars
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I love this app and I'm glad of it..
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I've tried a number of language apps and this is definitely my top pick. Favorite part is that the lessons are set up with a ton of speaking practice.
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,Mostly a great app! 👍🏻
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"This is awesome and totally free to use with any library card. The choice of languages is absolutely amazing. No ads! Legit a fun free way to try any language. Even types of dialects.... I'm still laughing because I need to brush up on my ""Scottish English"" for example. Try it!"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"the first word ""Free"" is fraudulent. except for the first word in each section, you got to pay for buying the courses. so the description is wrong."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"it's an excellent app that I have ever used in my life to learn languages, it's so amazing and practical. I would like to suggest that the app developers add the Bosnian language, which will make it the best , the Bosnian language is uncommon in most great apps like Blue Bird , I hope to get a reply on my review and I wish to see the Bosnian language between all these languages to learn it😊"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,تتطبق ممتاز لتعلم اللغة الكردية مع النطق
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,this is the best app if you are looking for improving listenibg.
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,very helpful in learning correct pronunciations and use of words.
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,Not really there yet.
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"Thanks, i still havent learned anything yet, but when summer comes, ill learn Japanese, besides it helps my future"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,موجود مشكلة في التطبيق اليوم لا يفتح بسبب فيروس بداخله حذفته وقمت بتحميله مرة أخرى نفس الشيء لا أعرف المشكلة في التطبيق او في الجهاز
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,Am looking for a language app. the interface for flashcards sucks. you can't tap the screen to show the foreign word. you have it rate your u derstanding. highly disruptive. poorly done. could be tap to show answer; swipe right for next. rate the word. edit: fair response.
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"buena app para aprender idiomas, la recomiendo"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"Bluebird’s Limitations: No Generative Practice: -Memorizing ""I ate rice"" doesn’t teach you to create ""She will cook soup"" unless the app trains sentence structure manipulation. Limited Contextual Variety: -Pre-set phrases may not cover diverse scenarios (e.g., storytelling, hypotheticals), leaving gaps in applying tenses flexibly. Passive Learning: Focuses on recognition/repetition, not active creation of sentences."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I actually wanna go back to school for real. spot on blue bird w
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"Great for pronunciation. I've only been on a few days, at the 'no cost' level. It seems great so far."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"I really like this app, and it's really useful but I just wish they had the alphabets as well, makes it so much easier to understand which sounds correlate with them"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I would have to say that *It is actually THE BEST LANGUAGE LEARNING PRESENT on the play store right now *. 😃 Features ⚙️ : 1. Tons of vocab for FREE 🫡🤫 2. Almost all the languages that One could need to learn 📖 3. Fair Charges 💰
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"Update: if you can't understand why having a robot shout over the language practice is bad & not improved by switching robots, I can't dumb it down enough for you to figure out. And being snide is no way to get a lost customer to do your job for you. The (audio only) lessens get you into the habit of repeating after the native speaker, only for the obnoxiously chipper American (in my case) to suddenly start shouting the next prompt over you because they didn't bother to leave time at the end."
com.codeway.aitutor,the best
com.codeway.aitutor,good
com.codeway.aitutor,"it is very good app , but the pro version is very expensive , i hope the owners make the pro version more affordable and cheap, i think 25 us dollars is good for one year subscription ."
com.codeway.aitutor,just doesn't work for me
com.codeway.aitutor,is first I like it 😂😁😁😁😁
com.codeway.aitutor,excited
com.codeway.aitutor,Definitely is not free
com.codeway.aitutor,Armenian language pronunciations are very poor. You need to do more train your AI more and more of Eastern Armenian pronunciation for it to pronounce the words such that people and especially teens understand
com.codeway.aitutor,Easy Peasy
com.codeway.aitutor,"Adds say it's free, well... This is actually not free at all."
com.codeway.aitutor,great
com.codeway.aitutor,this is so splendid app
com.codeway.aitutor,Great
com.codeway.aitutor,very good

com.codeway.aitutor,Nice aap
com.codeway.aitutor,💯
com.codeway.aitutor,good
com.codeway.aitutor,"very interesting, I like it. 😊.. thanks guys!!"
com.codeway.aitutor,"no sirve, se queda pegada cuando le saludas"
com.codeway.aitutor,One word - horrible. On top of that app add says it is free. It isn't. So it is straight misleading on the level of a scam. Plus all reviews with 5 stars are fake
com.codeway.aitutor,why I waited two stars cuz it tells me like I asked to speak Spanish and it did not speak Spanish I literally it has to be paid 99.00 literally you got to be kidding me can we have it for free at least in Spanish it's just litter in Spanish don't download this game
com.codeway.aitutor,Thought it would be more like chatgpt. Didnt find it useful. Hard to cancel.
com.codeway.aitutor,nice al
com.codeway.aitutor,it's helpful
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,very well
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,I love it. I'm an A1 in French and this app help me a lot.
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"OMG I'm in love with this app. I've just downloaded and tried it but it's very helpful and simple. I could adjust the weakness point at my own pace of study. I love how the correction explains the mistake and gives the tip. It's a shame it's not free, but this app is totally amazing. So much better than the many other apps that I tried before. 100/10 💖"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,no it is my dad's phone that I am using it is anytime my daddy comes back from work that I am using but the time that he travels I will not have time 😘😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆👍🏼😆😆🙏🏾😂😂👍🏾😊📷🍿😀😃😄😅😅😁😆😘☀️🙏🏼😂👍👍🏼😊🤪🙈💩🤖👺👹👽👾😹😼😽😽🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀😽😼😻😹🧡💥💨💦💦🌟🌟⭐🌟💤🕳️🔥💜💯🎉🎉❤️🧡💛💛💚💚💚💚💙💙💜💜🤎🤎🤎💗💖💘💘🤍🖤🤍💖💗💗💝💘💘💝💖💖💗💗💓💞💕👥👤🗣️🗣️💌💟💟♥️♥️❣️❤️‍🩹💔💔❤️‍🔥💋💋🫂🦠🫁🩸🫀🧠👣🗣️👤👥🦷🦴👀👁️👄👅👃🏼👂🏼🦻🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🦻🏿💪🏿🙋🏿🙋🏿🙇🏿🙇🏿i
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Lessons and grammatical explanations are good, but the lessons are ridiculously limited. You only get one very short lesson a day and even though it says you can get a maximum of seven lessons per week, I'm only able to get them on weekdays. Nothing on weekends. So that's a max of five per week. If you want to increase your language abilities in a hurry, don't count on this app. Plus it's higher priced than most of the language apps I've tried. So I'm paying maximum price for minimum services."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"It's really quite a lovely app. Though it just gives you a free trial and then you have to get a subscription. But if you can afford it, you should subscribe. I think it's a great combination with Duolingo."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,impeccable. Just excellent. please please make another version of this app for German
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,costs money
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,Enjoyable app with excellent customer service.
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,All lessons unavailable
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Definitely the best French learning app I've ever seen. Simply extraordinary! It encourages you to read more and more French in a challenging way (differently from Duolingo), while also adapting the lessons to your level (differently from Babbel). Simply the best!"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,not good
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,You can't unsubscribe. The quality of the lessons is low. Don't buy them.
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Too expensive, in 7 days trial, you don't even tell what is included in this price because next lessons are hidden, I don't see the program. Also, to identify the level of my French, I have to go through 7-day testing. 7 days to know what my French level is. Hilarious. What if I was sick and missed one day? I have to pay you $300? I have many things to write, but yeah, it's really not worth it."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,Frantastique is superb. Wish there could be longer drama clips made to watch out of learning space
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"its such a good app,i love it!thanks for lessons ❤️‍🩹"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Non potendosi permettere di pagare il corso, è data la possibilità di inviare un link e, se la persona utilizza l'app tu ottieni due mesi gratuiti e lei uno. Ebbene non ha funzionato, di conseguenza ho perso tempo ad inviare il link: grazie frantastique"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"I really liked this app because it really teaches french including grammar in french with option to translate. It also has cultural content and option to choose french/canadian. The reason that I do not continue beyond the trial is the limited amount of lessons per week and the lack of repetition. If would work extremely well with one of these duo-lingo style app, if it was using same vocabulary. and then there is a small issue with the start of the audio getting cut of when listening first time"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Challenging,that is why I like it,but entertaining too."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,excellent app!
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,Doesn't work
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Misleading. Here it initially makes it seem like after 1 test lesson, the app starts to adapt to your level of fluency & tailor the lessons to you. You get a 7-day free trial so that seems long enough to gauge how things work. However, they don't adjust the lessons until AFTER you take 7 difficult lessons in 7 days. Essentially, you can't experience the app properly until you pay. I'm a beginner & wasn't scoring more than 60% on any lesson, discouraging & difficult to continue the 7 lessons"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,Best app learning french
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,It's a fun way to learn and practice. I usually look forward to have my lesson.
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Extremely expensive, but cool concept."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Started well; tested l to evaluate user fluency, to tailor content. But inflexible, doesn't see when you've got it right if you include the next word as well, as in ""moins vite"" which didn't require the ""vite"". I've answered «on a répète» rather the «on a répéter». In the correction, I'd like to see the verb conjugated to put my error in context."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,Great way to improve your French.
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"it means a lot to me,everyday my lessons going better"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,very good app 👍

ru.poas.frenchwords,lots of info; pronunciation and vocab
ru.poas.frenchwords,"Awesome app! I started to study French words and I really like it! the premium version is super affordable and it's worth it! I love the option to add your own pictures for each and every word - that's genius! (a message to the developers - Please please make Traditional Chinese characters version! I'm studying Chinese as well and wanted to purchase Chinese, but there is only Simplified version.)"
ru.poas.frenchwords,When you start it gives three options to pay for it with no free option so I think I may have bren charged money for it. It keeps going into a blue screen almost like a full page ad that you have to keep closing . So annoying I quit the app before learning 1 word and uninstalled it. What kind of a moron thought that was a good idea? Grade = F.
ru.poas.frenchwords,"good for revising words that you're likely to forget because of lack of practice. can also add your own vocabulary, although dictionary doesn't always have the words you search for."
ru.poas.frenchwords,"This is incredibly useful, probably at pretty much all levels of French learning, I feel. I like all the functions and options. It is simple to use, not a lot of bells and whistles, which suits me perfectly. I get quite a buzz from vocab learning, especially when I'm reading a book or watching a video and I recognise a word I've learnt... a word which probably seemed pretty random at the time! I really recommend this one, as it has definitely furthered my French learning. No negatives either."
ru.poas.frenchwords,Great app. Must more words now. Need words MORE NOW MUST! GIVE ALL WORDS NOW.
ru.poas.frenchwords,I love it ♥️
ru.poas.frenchwords,Best flash card app for vocab. Easy to use. Way more user friendly than anki
ru.poas.frenchwords,I started with the gaming style of language learning apps but I now like this one so much better than those gaming language apps. It's rewarding enough just to feel like I'm learning.
ru.poas.frenchwords,"quite decent actually, this is my first time using the concept of flashcards and it's been pretty helpful since then, but I can definitely see a room for improvement in this app so never stop optimizing développeurs!"
ru.poas.frenchwords,It's OK. The thing I don't like it's that not every word has examples below
ru.poas.frenchwords,"gave it 5 stars, but now pronunciation doesn't work on example sentences."
ru.poas.frenchwords,simple. easy. perfect !
ru.poas.frenchwords,"Great app, but I can't keep my lifetime subscription when I move from one phone to another, I don't want to pay again to get the subscription on my new phone"
ru.poas.frenchwords,great app
ru.poas.frenchwords,It's clean and it works well.
ru.poas.frenchwords,it is quite good
ru.poas.frenchwords,that's exactly what I was looking for learning new words!
ru.poas.frenchwords,great
ru.poas.frenchwords,parfait app.
ru.poas.frenchwords,good experience so far 😄
ru.poas.frenchwords,great app!!! thank you
ru.poas.frenchwords,"I have been using this app for over a year now. Honestly, if you are learning French, I could not reccomended this app enough as one of the tools you use to master the language. I will do the 5 words a day, then review for 10 minutes daily. This, mixed with other ways of getting exposure and practice really work. All that, and you can do it for free on this app. Well worth it"
ru.poas.frenchwords,Awesome
ru.poas.frenchwords,"It's pretty good and definitely what I've been looking for. What would make it better is more information for words, like showing if it is an adjective or a noun, and examples using words in a sentence, which is done for some words and would be helpful if it were used for more."
ru.poas.frenchwords,AMAZING 👏👏👏 IT HELPED SO MUCH 😀
ru.poas.frenchwords,"It's an excellent app, it's helping me to learn french"
ru.poas.frenchwords,I love this app it is actually fantastic 💯💯💯
ru.poas.frenchwords,Perfect app for learning new vocabulary
ru.poas.frenchwords,Clean interface Simple Effective Somwthing with a Bright future 🌏
us.nobarriers.elsa,"This new version is terrible. Essential features like translation and conversion are gone, there is no IPA transcription, and it’s no longer possible to practice the pronunciation of individual words. This seriously compromises the tool’s usefulness for language learning."
us.nobarriers.elsa,"An AI downgrade. The entire app seems to be vibe coded now, the new UI is very rough, leaking out of my screen now, and the new images are like my first AI project. The worst thing is the voice recordings have been replaced with an AI robot, lifeless and just plain artificial. I'll give it a week but very likely replace it with real people from YouTube."
us.nobarriers.elsa,A year or so back it was great. until it became an ai slop. i literally spell wrong words and still get excellent results. this app was great. now it is trash

us.nobarriers.elsa,"Awesome so far! You start practicing right talking right away. Please add a dark/grey theme and a feedback option (IPA transcription and sample pronunciation are correct, but ""I have to say it wrong for ELSA to give a high score""). Please refine intonation recognition exercises. It's hugely annoying to get them right. Even playing your sample records isn't recognized as correct."

com.bal.listenboise,I love this app! We live in a rural area where radio reception is spotty. Being able to listen to local channels is a treat!
com.bal.listenboise,love it!! my Bull station goes wherever I go!!
com.bal.listenboise,love that I am able to listen whenever and wherever I want
com.bal.listenboise,"The audio anytime you open the app or pause and then replay it has made it so I miss things quite often. The app also randomly closes and I have to reopen it then listen to that audio clip. If someone calls me and I answer it, I have to listen to that audio clip again before I can listen to the radio. It didn't used to have that audio clip. I was driving today and I switched from my Wi-Fi at home to a cell tower and it had to go through that audio clip! It is so annoying."
com.bal.listenboise,wish my favorite radio station didn't sound like it's on a CD with scratches on the back 😞😔😞😔😞😔
com.bal.listenboise,"All I could do is get it to open the home splash screen. No menu, no radio stations. A complete waste of time."
com.bal.listenboise,"There isn't a better way to start my weekday. I LOVE listening to Joey and Lauren every morning. If I'm not in the car, Alexa plays it for me, which I love. I hope they never leave radio!"

com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"really useful for me as an addition to Duolingo, it teaches grammar rules making sense of some of the stuff you learn but is not explained by Duolingo. You need to be studying french at the same time as using this app, it's definitely a supplement to learning not a language learning tool on its own. Also helps if you know grammar terms in English."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,very expensive compared to what you get
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,top mais juste pour la version premium
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"La mejor aplicación para aprender francés. Super accesible y completa, vale totalmente la pena adquirirla completa para estudiar por niveles."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,very good

com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Boring
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"If you don't plan on paying, don't bother with this app. Most content is locked in the free version, so much so that you can't even learn just the basics."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Great app but you have pay otherwise you can only access some lessons
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Thank you very much 😭😭😭
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"C'est magnifique, je viens juste de commencer à l'utiliser pour approfondir mes connaissances en franças quand il s'agit de la grammaire, et je vois déjà beaucoup des progrès avec tous est-ce que je sais en français, et en plus je me sens encore plus sûr de c'est-ce que je dit :) merci beaucoup pour cette appli, il m'a souve comme je n'habite pas dans un pays où le français est parlé, alors pour tous ces gens qui aimeraient améliorer en grammaire, utilise-le :) et encore une fois de plus, merci."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,J'adore le Dr French. Cette app est super. Tu adore aussi. Les leçons sont interrestines . I love Dr French. This app is great. You love it too. The lessons are interesting.
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"I wish I hadn't paid for this, though it's relatively cheap. I constantly have to google for clarification in lessons. The very first most basic lesson about sentence structure assumes you know how indirect objects function in French. I had to use Busuu to find a clear lesson about it. I don't think this is appropriate for beginners, but probably great if you already know a bit about French grammar."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"very helpful, with good explanations and effective practice exercises. well worth $8 full version"
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"Bastante buena la app solo que hay bloqueos de algunos temas lo cuales dificultan el auto aprendizaje de los mismos ,si hubiese sido mas abierta en ese sentido coloco las 5 estrellas ."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Good for learning French grammar.Easy to understand.
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Very nice app and best for students 😃😃😃👍👍👍
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"Thank you so much for clarified me out about this application, before I couldn't speak 🙊 french but now i wish can try to do my best 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰"
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Best app especially if you dont love learning in a basic set up.
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,It helps you to know more about french
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,It helps one to learn french as part of his or life
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"Good app. However, some lessons are too short so you cannot understand, which is pretty bad. For example, the lesson ""how to conjugate the present indicative 1"" is useless, it explains too little about the features and norms for the second group of regular verbs (-ir), something too important. Overall, I like the app, but you should put more attention to these factors, so everyone can understand fully. Plus, It has minor errors in some chapters, like ""how to use: combien ?"" That gotta be fixed."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Great!
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"V ddxxdfukvy vveyyj💙🙏🤍V ddxxdfukvy vveyyjHello boss, Kkkkkkuujkkkjjk Embark on a lucrative journey into the world of crypto mining with me!

com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"A solid, comprehensive app to learn (or review) French grammar. It explains concepts well and is nicely organized, with lots of quizzes to practice as you go along. Minor complaints = it should open to where you left off and remember what level you chose. The feedback on wrong answers to quizzes is often completely useless."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,I appreciate it 97% good
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"This is a wonderful app, but it needs to be used in tandem with other practice oriented apps such as Duolingo. This app fills a very important void in our learning space, so that we not only know what is happening, but we get you know WHY and HOW it's happening."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Just did the update and I see know option to change to the dark mode :-( Cannot use it anymore..
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,you can tell it's made by peoplewho love language
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,it's been giving me the same lesson for about 10 consecutive times now. Do I need to upgrade from the free plan to escape this loop?
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,it's a great concept and the platform is amazing to learn.
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"I'm learning Japanese with this app, and so far so great, but please add furigana for every kanji, I can probably guess the furigana just by listening, but I still need it"
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"AWFUL, THE WORST! I regret paying for PRO with the new version. In the previous version, I could search for Memrise created content and learn via bitesize learning modules I chose, based on things such as basics, numbers, specific grocery items. But now I either have to select massive learning modules where I have no control over what I learn or in what order, or select pathways created by random users. If I want a custom plan, I have to create the plan by entering every single word."
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,love this app
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,The apps is very convenient compared to Duolingo.
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,Better than Duolingo
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"not saving progress, repeating the same number lesson."
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,best learning app I ever see as compared to Duolingo no adds and learning from zero to expert
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"The first app I tried that is actually useful. There are a few low-quality recording, but otherwise - perfect. Inwas suprised, but I actually enjoy using the app which is helpful while studying."
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"requested a refund for the lifetime plan, and nobody responds. They have closed my tickets without response as well. they even took away my membership without even refunding it. the app itself is fine but the complete lack of customer support is"
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,not for begginers
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,I like it butt one problem on this app this aap have no scottish gaelic language option and that's why I rating this aap only 4 and anyway it's good
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"This is a great language learning app that personalizes learning based on your learning goals. It doesn’t have a robotic feel to it, and the real-life videos make learning very natural and effortless. The short lessons and smart reviews also help you remember things better. Highly recommended!"
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,I am a university Chinese teacher. This app may be good for other languages but it has a long way to go for Chinese. I was checking to see if I could use it in class but unfortunately many of the translations are incorrect. one example is 自助 which they teach as meaning 'buffet'. This is not true. the word for buffet includes that word but it is not buffet by itself. Unfortunately there is a 500 character limit for reviews. Use something else if learning Mandarin until they fix their issues.
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,very good
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,best app for me
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,Absolutely love this app it makes things easy to understand and it repeat mistakes i make until I get it right
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,very good.
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,This is a great app for learning new languages.
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,good app
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"Brilliant learning app, however it's a shame you can no longer use if offline with the new versions of the app"
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,good
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"It's great. I love it, it helps someone learn quickly more than Duolingo"
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"2015: it is legitimately fun to learn with memrise, i'm not even kidding i can now learn german and japanese when i can't sleep at night or during pauses in the day. also it's fairly easy so that's always a plus. so if ur thinking about it... just try it out bc youll probably be glad you did :D 2026- They removed ASL from the main app. Very stupid. Those courses are the only thing that has kept me coming back: what they call the 'community courses' are some of the coolest ones. They're removed."
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,A very good app. Makes Duolingo look pathetic
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,Not great for memory or long term language skills. material is not designed or laid out in a way that encourages long-term memory and engagement. The app will allow you to continuously make mistakes without correcting you so you actually memorize improper sentence structure. the native language speaker is great but there's downsides to how they present it
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"The ""hear my words"" section it's Ads even in paid version. That is truly bad"
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,good

net.tandem,"full of bugs, people speaking who don't appear in the list of users in the chat room, and also bots"
net.tandem,"excelente, personas muy amigables"
net.tandem,"Used to be a very ""Lovely platform to learn"" but, now they limit every single good feature to learn unless you make payment. using this application since 2016-2017 or something and really hates those limitations like translation on personal messages in which essential features since I joined like around 9-10 years ago."
net.tandem,I like how the updates make the app more accessible and easier to connect with other people. I almost always find someone to talk to. edit as of 2026: a lot of features are now locked behind a paywall. The free to use experience is a lot more limited now.
net.tandem,I logged in my account and find out I can't sent message to anyone anymore 🥺
net.tandem,it's a cool app but I wish there were more features that were free. also there's some kind of a bug where my Gboard keyboard doesn't work properly and I get so so many typos :/
net.tandem,"It is amazing and useful , through it u can make new friends and talk with antive speakers ... Well done and many thanks for this app 💯 But , it would be better if the technicians of the app can add the feature of going on live streaming , so it would be more exciting :)"
net.tandem,"Не могу подключить про версию, потому что приложение говорит, что в РФ платежная система отключена. Так а я уже несколько лет не в РФ и с другими приложениями никаких проблем и всё оплачивается, а тут нет. Хотел бы подключить про версию, но не могу. Почему разработчики не могут сделать проверку по региону платежа я не понимаю"
net.tandem,"good app with few things to be reviewed. for example many speakers in a voice room sometimes it has a negative impact rather than something positive also, I think it will be better if you give the listeners the option of commenting."
net.tandem,"it's a good app, I recommend"
net.tandem,Very good application for practicing your languages.
net.tandem,"Paid for premium membership and i can't access my profile. They ignore your messages, don't bother to respond/ help. Stay away"
net.tandem,useful for practicing writing and speaking
net.tandem,the new version is absolutely garbage
net.tandem,bad experience with administrators
net.tandem,"can't log in, the app is currently bugged. I did reach out to support multiple times over several days and never got a response."
net.tandem,"A fun and vibrant community of language learners. The group chat feature was a good idea, but maybe overshadowed by parties. It could benefit from sticker support or other small adjustments learned from social media."
net.tandem,"Some people in the app are very rude and they really don't care about practice the language. There's a serious problem with men harassing women. Team work should check and solve this cuz at the end, the intention of the app is good but is just not working like they planned. :/"
net.tandem,Bad app.
net.tandem,so good
net.tandem,Chats are disappearing! Started just recently.. And I've been a member for years. I'll not renew unless they fix thus fast.
net.tandem,slowest garbage app.
net.tandem,Utter joke app! Go through the whole sign up only to discover have to wait a WEEK before learning.... Or you can PAY! No thanks.
net.tandem,"this app suffers from the same things hellotalk suffers from with many of it's users using it for dating and communication being appearance based where it's advertised as a language learning/friend app. this app has gone downhill from what it used to be, no one is friendly anymore"
net.tandem,"I installed from the Play Store, and later updated using the Aurora client, which gets it from the Play Store. Tandem now refuses to run, claiming that I must get it from the Play Store…which is where it came from. Tandem is in the wrong, and should release an update that corrects this behaviour."
net.tandem,I'm have a bff in here haha
net.tandem,"que asco de aplicación la descargue hoy después de años de haberla usado y es comercial tras comercial no se puede hacer nada, no te deja seleccionar varios idiomas para aprender, es una basura de app, ah y está llena de spam"
net.tandem,"Me encanta la app, la mayoría de la gente es respetuosa y está genuinamente interesada tanto en compartir sus experiencias como ayudarte a mejorar en el idioma, realmente si me tuviera que quejar de algo en específico sería que (desconozco los motivos por los que pasa esto) pero es la unica app donde el teclado tiene un montón de bugs y es incómodo de escribir, edit: además se buguea al hacer audios y se borran solos, si pudieran arreglar eso sería estupendo"
net.tandem,The app used to be so much better. Recently it's super buggy and slow. Really ruins the experience. Such a pity.
net.tandem,"I'm new to Tandem and I'm excited to use it and learn. I'm glad it is a more serious app than some of the others. It seems to have been the right choice to have picked this app. I'm not familiar with it yet, but I'm glad for the simplicity of the app."
ai.talkpal,I like this app
ai.talkpal,"Good app, but in dialog mode one voice is always much louder than the other. Is there any way to fix this?"

ai.talkpal,10 min😡😡😡.... .... ....
ai.talkpal,"You might have great experience if you pay premium but if you are not gonna then this is the worst app, just a waste of time. Nothing is free and even if something is free it's only 10 minutes of chat. 😮‍💨 what would one do with 10 minutes?"
ai.talkpal,I asked google for free tool. but this app is paid.
ai.talkpal,Good stuff!! Language rainbows!! 🌈🌈🌈
ai.talkpal,不付费无基本功能可用
ai.talkpal,👎🏻

com.masterenglishprogram,"No he probado la app en sí, no he pasado del cuestionario, pero se me hace demasiado largo para al final darme cuenta de que hay que pagar para usarla, parece que promete, eso lo probare el dia que pague por ella, pero el hecho de que llenes una extensa encuesta, crees tu cuenta, y luego al final te digan que es de pago es algo molesto."
com.masterenglishprogram,É pago
com.masterenglishprogram,I recommend is very good tool to lorn inglés
com.masterenglishprogram,I wasted my time answering a lot of questions
com.masterenglishprogram,"Es bastante buena esta aplicación, sólo que debes de tener mucha disciplina para meterte a diario y hacer el programa, me cuesta trabajo entrar a diario, me gana la pereza por ver redes sociales 🙃 en vez de abrir Master English, me dirijo a abir Instagram...así no se puede caray 🥲"
com.masterenglishprogram,"Es de pago, al final te solicita pagar una suscripción."
com.masterenglishprogram,"Descargue y pague la suscripción, sin embargo, considero que debería existir manera de saber que no es compatible con algunos celulares, además es publicidad engañosa porque en la publicidad muestran conversaciones en la que se da a entender que puedes hablar con la IA cuando quieras y no es así, primero debes hacer un montón de ejercicios de vocabulario, gramática y lectura para llegar a una pequeña conversación con la IA, en mí caso, estoy estudiando Inglés, y solo quiero conversaciones."

com.vocabularyminer.android,Ayuda a construir vocabulario
com.vocabularyminer.android,"Easy to use. I lose interest in a lot of flashcard apps quite quickly, but I'm finding this one fun. You can create your own flashcards, and bulk add vocabulary on the online version of the app. If there is a size limit, I haven't found it (created a deck with 6000 words)."
com.vocabularyminer.android,Very useful application.
com.vocabularyminer.android,Best App for Self Learning In Any Language
com.vocabularyminer.android,Simple in a good way. Great integration with Google Translate for web extraction of saved word lists.
com.vocabularyminer.android,Great to fill in spare moments with something useful.
com.vocabularyminer.android,Not what i was looking for
com.vocabularyminer.android,Perfect app for learning vocabulary. Love it
com.vocabularyminer.android,super useful
com.vocabularyminer.android,Sometimes I can't understand what is going on
com.vocabularyminer.android,Nice little app. Table import (e.g. copy & paste from excel) is the best feature. Makes it very easy to transfer words from my Spanish course to the app. Would be great if you could share lists between specific accounts. Feature request: I would pay extra if i could transfer the vocabulary of my lingoda classes directly into this app!!
com.vocabularyminer.android,Unique and direct to the point
com.vocabularyminer.android,"Skvělá aplikace, jednoduchá, snadná. Snadnější učení nových slovíček."
com.vocabularyminer.android,Easy to used
com.vocabularyminer.android,One of the most useful app i ve seen recently. All thumbs up!
com.vocabularyminer.android,Makes learning fun!
com.vocabularyminer.android,"I would love the app, if it wasn't for the bug, causing nonsense translations showing approx every other day. I checked the translations in my vocabulary lists several times, they're all correct, yet I do sometimes get wrong translations when learning (I hope I notice all of these)."
com.vocabularyminer.android,"Great app. I was actually thinking of developing my own flashcard app, and after doing some research to see if anything similar was already out there, I came across vocabulary miner. It has pretty much everything I was thinking of for my app, so I quickly discarded the idea and am now a proud premium member! The only thing it's missing is a ""set as mastered button"" for words that are already committed to long-term memory that would send words straight to box 8 (ask in 60 days)."
com.vocabularyminer.android,"This app would be very useful with the simple addition of text to voice using Android built in multilingual tts. Without it, it is not as useful as other apps like Anki."
com.vocabularyminer.android,It does what it says. Nice and easy flashard apps with import from excel
com.vocabularyminer.android,This is a great app for easily making flash cards from Excel file. It would be better if more personal settings become available for example setting the maximum number of words for learning and review.
com.vocabularyminer.android,Love it
com.vocabularyminer.android,It really helped me to learnt vocab at my ease.
com.vocabularyminer.android,"Nice clean easy to use app, reliable data connection on different devices, easy mass import via Web"
com.vocabularyminer.android,Clean and easy to understand interface. I love how easy it is to import long lists of words and to edit cards as you go. The srs system is great. I looked at a lot of flashcard apps and this one had exactly what I wanted!
com.vocabularyminer.android,"Pretty good for learning vocabulary. I like that it keeps track of how many cards you've learned and how many you're still unsure on. I wish there was a way to re-classify words you've classified as ""I know it"" as ""unsure"" or ""no idea."""
com.vocabularyminer.android,Very easy to use and the sync between the web interface and the app work perfectly. It has many UX details that makes it very intuitive and pleasurable to use.
com.vocabularyminer.android,Best app for learning new languages!
com.vocabularyminer.android,I love this app simple and intuitive. It does its jobs perfectly. Thanks.
com.vocabularyminer.android,Really good app with great connection with 3rd party apps.

org.edx.mobile,do edx online. exercises don't work on the app as they do not fit in the screen (samsung galaxy) and scrolling sideways is not possible (blank page)
org.edx.mobile,"edX is a great learning app that provides access to high-quality online courses from top universities and institutions. The app makes it easy to watch lectures, track progress, and study at your own pace. I appreciate the variety of subjects available. Some certificates are paid, but the learning experience is excellent."
org.edx.mobile,edX offers high-quality courses from top universities. Learning content is well-structured and informative. Great for skill development and education. An excellent learning platform.
org.edx.mobile,this edx app platform it really easy to learning and study at anytime and anywhere. it really easy to access and used
org.edx.mobile,Please make your app icon in India more colourful/appealing to use....
org.edx.mobile,"impressive, moreover it's free! . Thank you edX"
org.edx.mobile,Pembelajaran online berkualiti.
org.edx.mobile,"edX is 🎓🔥! 😄 Learn from the best, tons of courses, and knowledge = power! 👍"
org.edx.mobile,DO NOT PURCHASE!!! I was so excited online to register for a January course that I purchased multiple courses at once. Imagine my dismay when I attempted to start and I was placed in a March cohort. I emailed support and was told I could begin sooner but when I asked to change they wouldn't. Access is a scam!! Why would I buy a self paced online class to have to wait 60 days to begin? Nonsensical. Completely misleading the consumer.
org.edx.mobile,this is helpful 😀 and amazing 🤩
org.edx.mobile,quickandsimply understandable
org.edx.mobile,Great platform to gain skills but many of the courses are really unaffordable for many.
org.edx.mobile,So refreshing and very educating 💯
org.edx.mobile,excellent
org.edx.mobile,"i tried abouut 8 apps for learning chinese. they do work but are paywalled. this one is free, but surprisingly, it has been even better at teaching than the other apps. i dont say 100% recomended. i say *This Is the One* app you want to learn chinese"
org.edx.mobile,"While I love the concept and website, the app is bad. It doesn't track my process at all and I have to constantly revisit the same parts of my courses without being able to actually fully complete, because whenever I leave the app and open it later the 'pick up where you left' button brings me to a section I've completed days ago, it even takes me through the already done and completed quiz only for taking me back AGAIN the next day. It's annoying really"
org.edx.mobile,I love EdX. Started using it in 2013 to take a math class I needed in order to finish my MBA and been taking classes from time to time since.
org.edx.mobile,Working in a library means we are constantly helping others find reliable information. edX has helped me sharpen my own research and data management skills through their professional certificate programs. I love that I can 'audit' courses for free to gain knowledge or choose the verified track to add international credentials to my resume. It’s an empowering tool for library staff in the Pacific.
org.edx.mobile,"love this app, I used it to upgrade my skills, it's a user friendly app and so many courses to choose from."
org.edx.mobile,thanks is all I can say....
org.edx.mobile,good
org.edx.mobile,not alot of free options
org.edx.mobile,"The edX app is an excellent platform for learning anytime, anywhere. It offers high-quality courses from top universities and institutions around the world.

A great choice for anyone who wants to upgrade their skills or learn something new at their own pace."
org.edx.mobile,can't apply coupon on app
org.edx.mobile,app doesn't gives the certificates even if they're free
org.edx.mobile,"I've already been to about 4 different online courses and EdX is definitely the best, easy to understand, highly informative and interactive. EdX is a MiT side project, their reputation is extremely awesome! 👍"
org.edx.mobile,Garbage. Shoves down a chat bot on your face and wastes your screen. There is no option to hide or drag it which makes reading anything just a chore. Utter and total garbage.
org.edx.mobile,perfect app
org.edx.mobile,"unable to login. always keeps on saying that i don't have an account when i try to continue with google.

com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,"Broken app. Worked just long enough for me to subscribe since the quality of the voices was initially excellent. Hasn't worked since. Updated the app. Restarted it. Uninstalled. Reinstalled. Short texts. Novel length manuscripts from docs format, text format, etc., and literally nothing. Don't waste your time and money like I did. See the other reviews. Truly pathetic. Zero stars if it was available. These guys should be thrown out of the Google Play store."

com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,i paid for unlimited but then reached limit and its impossible to reach anyone for technical support
com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,Terrible. I've been needing a text to speech app for some time now and this one gave me so much hope but instantly was let down. Ripped me off of 40$ just to have the app not work and barely used for 5 minutes. No option for refunds anywhere. Extremely disappointed!
com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,great if you somehow find that you want to listen to about 12 words without upgrading to premium.
com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,lousy

com.pandora.android,"I have remained loyal to Pandora for 15 years. The last couple years they psd me off. getting rid of likes, now ads. now today they deleted my 13 year old fallout new Vegas soundtrack station. I'm done. goodbye Pandora, forever."
com.pandora.android,Great
com.pandora.android,l love it ❣️
com.pandora.android,great
com.pandora.android,"This app is the very definition of Spyware. It constantly runs in the background without your consent and it runs in the background of your phone harvesting data. As if the app doesnt already ask for the user for permission to very personal data itself, for months, weeks, and days(And potentially years). It will have complete monitorization of your account, as I made the mistake of doing. Click the 3 bars on your phone and click ((#) Active app) n you will see Pandora running. beware."
com.pandora.android,good
com.pandora.android,biggest issue is volume changes when it goes from music to adds. cut back on listening because of it. other then that no issues
com.pandora.android,Love the App but Developers need to clean it up. Fix the thing so it's not constantly running in the background. Fix the app so it doesn't auto connect everytime the car is started. How about if I want it to play I'll start it without having to reboot my phone 2-3 times when I've disabled it so it doesn't auto start.
com.pandora.android,"updated review for Jan 2026, The new update to android auto is atrocious and makes the app dangerous to use in a car. They've increased the amount of scrolling you need to do to find anything by a significant amount, options are now behind multiple menus and the app does it's ""safety pause"" CONSTANTLY making me stare at a loading screen while I'm supposed to be driving. It will do it's safety pause randomly, even after A SINGLE INTERACTION of the back button after listening to a song."
com.pandora.android,The name. Creepy. Frightened me. I put out music. lol. Good enough but don't be a skipper.
com.pandora.android,keeps saying off line mode?? what am I paying for? I have full service and wifi
com.pandora.android,keeps randomly shutting off.
com.pandora.android,greatest thing I've never done!
com.pandora.android,very glitchy when riding in the car lately. as well as repetitively saying I'm an offline mode even though I have full service have to delete the app and then re-download sometimes repetitively. premium user by the way... update! From 2 star to 1 star I continue to stay in offline mode with full cell service IN MY HOME. any more of this issue and I'm gonna have to cancel my subscription and find a new app cause this is insulting. I shouldn't have to troubleshoot an app glitch that I pay for!
com.pandora.android,"i promise you that if you rig your app to turn itself back on when I force-stop it, and then it spies on my phone and drains my battery in the background, I'm going to cancel my subscription that I've had for over a decade, and delete this app. Unless I select to run it, I don't want it running. Keep it up, and it goes."
com.pandora.android,"this needs an update in a bad way. I'll go days without using it then get an alert that it's slowing down my phone. it cuts out like a scratched CD. it shuts down mid song which can be embarrassing when you're singing along. and when I close the app because I'm done with it, it just keeps playing. there is no actual ""close app"" option that I've ever found. it's disappointing because I've been on Pandora since 2010. all other apps are horrible so I keep putting up with this one"
com.pandora.android,I love Pandora so much because it's a great music experience that I can listen to my phone when I do my chores and I experience on my life
com.pandora.android,AMAZINGGG
com.pandora.android,I like their numerous choice in music they have a wide variety
com.pandora.android,Love my pandora

com.pandora.android,This app is absolutely Perfect
com.pandora.android,"great app, just download it and use it"
com.pandora.android,A+ No complaints in 8 years and have never had any issues with Pandora 🤘
com.pandora.android,because when I try to log in it says I got to type and it free so this why am rate it a bad app 😡😡😡
com.pandora.android,good
com.pandora.android,"I dont really have any issues with the app, it plays each song well and having an easy-to-use drop down for the playlists, stations, podcasts, etc is extremely handy. My ONLY complaint, is the shuffle. I hate that for a playlist, the very first song in the list is always the default to play. When selected, I hear so many of the same songs each time I turn on shuffle, and not enough of many other songs I know are on the list."
com.pandora.android,Pandora will keep your card information at keep charging you after you cancel your subscription. I canceled my subscription with them last year 12/15/2025 and they are still charging my card that I even took off the account and they still charge me. one of the reasons I canceled my subscription the started charging me twice a month. To make matters worse they make it very hard to contact them only through email. there is no phone number when u email them they don't even reply. This fraud
com.pandora.android,"Love, Love Love it!!!! great as always . I've been using this app since it first came out seems like a 100 years ago. still great actually it's getting better every year . and ITS STILL FREE. with the free version you'll hear some pleasant Radio style Ads every once in a while but the paid version IS a bit better because you get some added functions like endless replays if your really stuck on n a song and you want to hear it 5 times in a row lol you also get endless skips. A winner App."
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,very helpful for review and practice
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,I love the simple design. It helps me focus on studying.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"I tried many other apps for conjugation, this one has the best style...."
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Amazing experience! Very helpful for refreshing my memory when it comes to French conjugation.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Je l'adore - Perfect to learn and drill new verbs as well as the conjunctions. Devs: here you have your support. de rien! :)
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,It's a handy reference app to have if you are learning French and just need to know how to conjugate a verb. You can look up any tense for almost any verb or you can also use it to practice conjugation through short tests. Very useful!
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"I've had purchased this app, it worked for certain period of time, later it started showing error 'Unfortunately not able to open this app'. I reinstall ed it.. started working but as soon as I used restore purchase option it verified me and unlocked the interface and then same above issue occurred."
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,perfect
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,A pretty good app that lets you get instant feedback while filling out grammar conjugation tables.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,it's shocking how quickly I'm learning my conjugations! This app is a sure fire way to get them nailed down!
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"Very nice , user friendly"
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Very convenient; it's worth it!
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"I tried like a dozen french verbs conjugators. Finally got this one, paid for all the content. Its the best one out there ive tried. Still, I dont know why I can not remove tenses and keep the ones i want when checking out particular verbs. Not talking bout the tests, great there. Talking about reviewimg the verbs. Theres a lot there I dont need."
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Very Very Good. How do I upgrade to the full version?
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,I had purchased this app.. now they are not restoring my purchase.. and when it was purchased the app used to stop working.. this is scam so please do not purchase this one..
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Enjoy this app as it is easy to use and practice with. Being able to make your own practice lists and reference a chart to see the tenses have been helpful. One of the better conjunction apps I've tried.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"Good app, could be better if it included futur proche tense (which is actually used in spoken French), labeled ""futur simple"" as such rather than just ""futur"", allowed you to filter out tenses you don't care about in settings, and added a search bar at the top of the verbs list so you don't need to scroll through a few hundred to find the one you want."
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,tres drole
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,such a great and simple app for learning conjugation. love that I can make my own list too
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,great for pure verb drills. It would be cool with a few modifications to make it easier to type and focus on what you're trying to learn.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,This little app is an excellent addition to language learning. This isn't a language tutor it's strictly conjugation but it's such a help! Small bites you can do anywhere focusing on the specific verbs and tenses you need. A little practice with this will greatly boost your knowledge and free you to concentrate on actually expressing yourself rather than fumbling with tenses and verb forms. The low price makes the full version a no brainer. Highly recommended for the French boîte de outils
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"The idea is good, but the pronunciation is quite poor on my phone. je suis, is pronounced gee swiss, and nagement, is pronounced nahj e ment. I know these pronunciations are wrong, so I know I can't trust the rest either. Without proper pronunciations, I probably won't keep the app, though I do like the interface."
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,took a little while to work out it's functionality and then a little while how to make best use of it! but once there it becomes invaluable 👍
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Simple User Interface but Good User experience... Providing help and instruction with detailed explaination either.. 5 stars
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,what i was looking for but needs some exercises of phrases
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Very useful app! the clear examples and tense explanations really help except that there are some small mistakes in the phrases and there aren't any reflexive verb in the list. other than that it's very good. Great job!
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"Great app. A couple of improvements 1. Could do with highlighting the stem and the type of verb e.g ER/IR/RE when running tests. 2. Could do with being able to convert each conjugation to show the English e.g I went, you went, he went or I will go, you will go, he will go etc etc Overall well worth the money though, a few tweaks would make it a 5* without question"
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"excelente aplicación para aprender a. conjugar y a memorizar verbos, tiene pronunciacion lo cual es muy valioso, mucho contenido pasado presente futuro etc. y es accesible 100% recomendada y esta en español!"
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,perfect for perfecting your grammar! every time I have a few minutes I do a few rounds and it really helps.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,so handy to practice my conjugation
ai.mybuddy.talkingflashcards_new,"horrible. no in depth english usage, maybe more for beginners but certainly not for a fluent grade2 child with an english curriculum. be careful as to cancel early on and block payments at your bank. they ignored my refusal to commit after trial period though i mailed the next day after trying. luckily I blocked payments from them before trial period ended. I've mailed a few times but no response and there are still attempts to debit my account for payments. Please stop doing that"

com.datacamp,aplikasi ini sangat membantu saya dalam belajar bahasa pemrograman untuk menambah skill saya
com.datacamp,A key to great achievements if one considered it as a helper and a reliable source of information in various aspects.
com.datacamp,it is for anyone willing to learn new skills and it is great because you practice on every skill
com.datacamp,five star
com.datacamp,can't run a code
com.datacamp,very good to learn with
com.datacamp,"please fix the bug... when I want to click on an option suggested while coding, it displays multiple times I love this app"
com.datacamp,awesome
com.datacamp,Good app
com.datacamp,"I really like the courses and learning experience, but occasionally the app has loading issues during study sessions and requires a restart. Improving app stability would make it even better."
com.datacamp,Top data learning platform
com.datacamp,A nice app makes it easy to learn about the desire knowledge.
com.datacamp,"I highly recommend DataCamp for those interested in DataScience, AI or Machine Learning. The platform is so user-friendly, practical and understandable."
com.datacamp,"since this thing can't get refund, I'll give this 0/5 cause the lack of practices, why y'all give practices that the codes already exist there? lack of theory"
com.datacamp,I love your pedagogical approach
com.datacamp,waste of money and time.
com.datacamp,it is the best app to learn any Tech skill related to data
com.datacamp,Good
com.datacamp,"I've been using Data camp for an year now. I've got some discounted offer last year and renewal was also accordingly, that's how I was able to renew it. I like the way the courses have been taught here, the videos are of shorter duration and at the end of each section, assessments make sure that we've done it all. I would say studying here is addictive. 🙂 still I would suggest to add thorough assessments and better subscription plans so more people can benefit from this."
com.datacamp,"Better than traditional lessons, it's excellent with practicing modules"
com.datacamp,Good
com.datacamp,great for learning coding
com.datacamp,"Great platform, still figuring out and will give detailed review in the future."
com.datacamp,"dishonest business practices, it auto renewed my subscription without a way to get a refund without informing me."
com.datacamp,the simple way of understanding hard things get your flowers 🌹
com.datacamp,Data Camp changed my life
com.datacamp,"Haven't even used the app for 5 min, stuck on the same lesson, im doing exactly what it asked for, even check with someone who knows python, won't proceed and says the answer is wrong."
com.datacamp,"The main (desktop) app is very good, but the 'flashcards' feature doesn't work properly in the android app, specifically code examples in the sql flashcards don't format as blocks of code, just a single line, which is virtually unreadable."
com.datacamp,"Sorely disappointed. the lessons are and exercises are incredibly short and brief. no explanation of what's going on and what's worse is I got to an exercise in the Python training and dead ended when my correct answer was labeled incorrect. double and triple checked. no insights given into what was ""incorrect"" so the lesson could not progress. ran out of inspiration after that. 100% would not recommend."
com.datacamp,A very good and educative app.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,amazing
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,I just started but so far so good.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,I have been using Babbel+ for about a year and a half. my Spanish is much better than it was! the only thing lacking is clear direction on how to move up to the next level.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,Not a good app to learn Spain Spanish. Babbel Spain Spanish is Mexican Spanish. It is waste of my money and time. Non existing customer service! I regret that I subscribed for a year to find out later that the app is teaching me how to say words in Mecican Spanish and not in Spain Spanish. I picked it because it has Spain Spanish but in reality it is the same as Mexican Spanish. I am surprised people are still using this app.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"I don't know if this is an issue with french only, but I find that the pronunciation audio can be really low quality with buzzing in the background. the app also feels pretty clunky and slow - I thought it was just my phone but I've switched to a newer model and still find the reaction time to be slow. also, the way the app detects typos is weird - I can use a wrong verb form and it accepts it as a typo, but when I make an actual typo, it counts as a mistake."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,I wanted to learn ukrainian because thats where my family is from but you guys only have russian and not ukrainian. Will there be ukrainian added to babbel very soon? 🙏🙏🙏🙏 Please add Ukrainian to babbel asap(really prefer to learn that than russian)
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"I can't learn english because I speak Arabic, this is frustrating."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"top, bin sehr zufrieden"
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,language option not available. Googled how to learn Japanese. a link to Babbel literally saying learn Japanese. no Japanese option
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,not easy
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,excellent system for learning!!
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"Meh. I didn't realize this is not a free app. I kept waiting for things to unlock after lesson 1, and I had to Google why it was stuck. The only place it mentions that a subscription is required is a tiny section of the app description on Google Play (...they could say so within the app). I also hate ""streaks"" (just another guilt trip), and I saw there's no way to turn off streak tracking."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,There's no Japanese in babbel
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,really simple and easy to use
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,it great
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"do not recommend, its not free and since I signed up with email, I have had MANY scam emails about Google, Microsoft and cloud accounts being closed unless I 'click the link' these guys sell your info to scammers"
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"unlike most appe i think babbel is the best. the employees actually help and try to make their app better which really satifies me. not only that, the app is really organize and deeply understanding."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"seems friendly and focuses on the learners' understanding before going to the next. The app patient, super good"
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,so far very good.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,barely any languages to choose from and without paying for a subscription you get barely anything at all. the first lesson just straight up told me the answers to the question making it a terrible learning experience especially when every single next lesson is locked behind a subscription. massive disappointment might aswell just learn using Google translate at this point.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,Much better than Duolingo. Babbel doesn't have all those distracting cartoons and games. It focuses on learning the language.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,good app u need to try it
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,I am learning so much.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,great for people who learned Spanish from prison cellmates
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,easy to understand
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,you have to pay to do literally anything
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"there is no learning from serbian, and no info about update changes. i just pay subscription, but i want to learn from serbian. thank you."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"do not do their free trial. the placement test was done horribly. the ""free trial"" was actually a three minute lesson repeating ""hola"" and ""adios"" this is not an overstatement. I have spent now an hour and a half trying to get out of my trial membership they are making it absolutely impossible to get my money back. do not use babbel."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,keeps crashing
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"Practicing pronunciation using Babbel is an exercise in frustration. It will refuse to acknowledge your pronunciation is correct for random words (even if it is). Also some words are split into two unnecessarily. If you don't type them in exactly how they want, you are wrong, even though a native speaker confirms that Babbel is actually wrong. Great learning tool if you want to learn patience and incorrect spacing in words. I regret my purchase."
ai.praktika.android,"La mejor app para aprender inglés, sobretodo speaking and listening"
ai.praktika.android,"Interaction are getting worse and worse. I had great faith in AI, but now the boat is sinking fast. I don't feel this app is targeting my real weaknesses in my target language other than remember irrelevant facts about me. After one month of use I stop using it and I deeply regret my choice. How can I be that stupid."
ai.praktika.android,no russian
ai.praktika.android,I wanted to use it to learn Dutch but they don't have it😢
ai.praktika.android,I am impressed with the AI tutor
ai.praktika.android,ok
ai.praktika.android,im loving it so far very smooth
ai.praktika.android,very nice. fun
ai.praktika.android,"a free way to learn a new language? winning formula! Hontōni arigatō, purakutika"
ai.praktika.android,"I'm still testing the application, I Will come back to review after testing"
ai.praktika.android,this is so fun and easy to use!
ai.praktika.android,seems easy to use
ai.praktika.android,I love it
ai.praktika.android,"Good concept and execution but at least for Japanese every single one of the tutors sounds non-native, there are frequent pronunciation errors and many of the responses are unnatural."
ai.praktika.android,"I know two percent of Spanish, I can understand it a little bit more than I can to speak it. Hopefully this app will help me!"
ai.praktika.android,I'm just starting though but I think it's very helpful
ai.praktika.android,tutors speech translation in English is much needed to understand
ai.praktika.android,good App
ai.praktika.android,"it says free, but the app barely has any free content."
ai.praktika.android,I'm loving it
ai.praktika.android,Amazing 👏
ai.praktika.android,it seem legit cant wait to actual learn Japanese
ai.praktika.android,good App for beginners
ai.praktika.android,very good
ai.praktika.android,Perfect training ground
ai.praktika.android,seems OK 👍
ai.praktika.android,good
ai.praktika.android,"The app says nothing about costs until you go through several minutes of ""onboarding"" then hits you with a $99 price tag. Not a bad price if you can afford it, but DuoLingo is still free. Ill stick with that."
ai.praktika.android,I think this is ok
ai.praktika.android,This is a very good app to left any language.
com.google.android.apps.bard,I love the way the app represents the answers ....

cn.danatech.xingseus,This App has been great so far
cn.danatech.xingseus,Good app to help me about indoors plants for which problem about us to how to help that plnt
cn.danatech.xingseus,why has everything gotta be a subscription?
cn.danatech.xingseus,"Hate these ads, stop sending them."
cn.danatech.xingseus,Don't download this application. It's a rip off. You will never be able to cancel your subscription.
cn.danatech.xingseus,NOT FREE! SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED
cn.danatech.xingseus,thieves...auto charges
cn.danatech.xingseus,My brown thumb is turning green. This app has been a plant saver for my Christmas Cactus and snake plant.
cn.danatech.xingseus,I have been using this app for a couple years now. It's helpful with new plants and my older ones also.
cn.danatech.xingseus,wow I make a mistake and I get the wrong idea this find the real plant.
cn.danatech.xingseus,Semi useful information. But most information is locked behind a subscription wall.
cn.danatech.xingseus,I love this app. it's never put me wrong
cn.danatech.xingseus,new to this still learning how to use
cn.danatech.xingseus,"they are scam and will deduct subscription fee in your bank account, even if you didn't sign up be care full, serious fraud, I have a proof. SCAM ALERT!!!!"
cn.danatech.xingseus,Because the low rating. in plant is the very necessary on the planet Earth and planned carries almost free okay this is not a business
cn.danatech.xingseus,app works well. would recommend it.
cn.danatech.xingseus,I have been charged twice this month January 2026 for 29.95€ !! on 03 january and 25 january. Of course i immediately unsubscribe but cannot delete me payment card why you keep this ? i want to get refund !
cn.danatech.xingseus,"I love this app and the accuracy it has it amazing to me, it has correctly identified trees I've taken pictures of in the winter with zero leaves on them. It really surprised me but I guess it shouldn't have. It also has recommendations for sick plants or trees, watering schedules, basically more than I've needed. I think this app is for more experienced tree lovers than me but it still works great for what I want or need. 5 stars all the way."
cn.danatech.xingseus,love it
cn.danatech.xingseus,Deceptive ad. Free trial and then you have to subscribe.
cn.danatech.xingseus,Excellent 👍
cn.danatech.xingseus,not free. requires subscription
cn.danatech.xingseus,"deceptive marketing. offered a free trial, but extensive searching does not reveal any way to cancel. do not get tangled up with these scammers. also, very difficult to set up, an incredible amount of wasted time before it would actually identify anything."
cn.danatech.xingseus,Great app
cn.danatech.xingseus,10 outa 10
cn.danatech.xingseus,Excellent
cn.danatech.xingseus,So impressed with the data provided when identifying a mystery plant in our yard. This may become a favourite app for us.
cn.danatech.xingseus,"the app is fine, good even, but I just wanted to try it. and now I paid for it without any kind of warning. I won't renew. shady practice."
cn.danatech.xingseus,"they tell you how many downloads, but how many uninsalled this crappie app 99.9% I bet"
cn.danatech.xingseus,nice App.. very useful
ai.ai1min.application,decent app but the credit consumption is actually ridiculous needs to be cheaper as alot of these models are free ones
ai.ai1min.application,Can't copy the text when doing image to prompt. Probably the dumbest omission of all time! ONE STAR!!!
ai.ai1min.application,Excellent product for a great price. I use it every day.
ai.ai1min.application,"I’ve tried a lot of AI tools, and honestly, most of them feel either too complicated or not very useful. 1min AI surprised me. It’s simple, fast, and actually does what it says without a steep learning curve. I mainly use it for writing ideas, summaries, and quick content edits, and it saves me a lot of time. I like that I don’t have to jump between a bunch of different tools—everything is in one place. It’s not perfect, but for the price and convenience, it’s definitely worth using."
ai.ai1min.application,"Reality Check ✔️ Lifetime License Key on Social Stack. But Buy Credit Every Day, for Student's NoT Recommend."
ai.ai1min.application,"I have and use daily 1min AI pro. I have a lifetime subscription and I'm very glad I decided to purchase it. I've had the app for about a year now, it hasn't stopped improving nor does it show any signs of doing so. About weekly I get an email of everything they've improved, everything they're working on and everything they have planned. Let me tell you, they stay busy. 1minAI is your one stop shop for everything AI. If content is your thing,1minAI needs to be your partner."
ai.ai1min.application,It is nice as generally. But I think need to develop so don't response some times and etc. And I am continuing use and I hope will write again.
ai.ai1min.application,Its a one stop for multipurpose AI business and personal uses. The AI sources are kept up to date including Gemini and many more models.
ai.ai1min.application,wonderful app so many options so many things to do I just downloaded it and just truthly amazed
ai.ai1min.application,"My overall experience has been decent. I like the ability to switch between different AI models easily, but the high token consumption affects how often and how long I can use the platform."
ai.ai1min.application,awesome app. easy and useful way to compare between llm results.
ai.ai1min.application,"A large selection of various AI models are available. Also, a free daily credit of 15000 is wonderful."

ai.ai1min.application,Best value for All in One AI
ai.ai1min.application,"The app is easy to navigate with a great user interface, which saves me a lot of time compared to clunky alternatives. It gets it right the first time, too. When given a prompt, it produces a perfect result as one would want it, cutting down the need for constant re-prompting or tweaking. If you want reliability and speed, this is a great AI. I highly recommend!"
ai.ai1min.application,good ai app. good value. recommend
ai.ai1min.application,MUST HAVE!
ai.ai1min.application,exceptional I appreciate how everything is saved in the different categories I'm still not sure what to do with it but I'm entertaining myself for now.
ai.ai1min.application,"Great app bought it through stack social and still learning all the features .. I really got into creating ttettttt,eeee"
ai.ai1min.application,"while I do very much like enjoy it, the point system limiting how much you can use it coupled with VERY scant instructions,walkthroughs and examples of each element mean that by the time you've figured out exactly what you want your out of ""points"". Having a test spot (non downloadable) for each of the elements would be a VERY GOOD addition ."
ai.ai1min.application,"Subscription Overview: The Stack Social monthly subscription do offers good value overall. While individual AI services often provide free alternatives, this bundle consolidates multiple tools in one place for convenience. Credit Management: Credits are limited and deplete with every use so you should prioritize high-value tasks to maximize the monthly allowance. Additional free credits can be earned through activities like submitting reviews."

No more requiring multiple windows be open, and bouncing between them. one prompt, multiple interpretation of how to engage, create or interact."
ai.ai1min.application,not useful
ai.ai1min.application,Good app! lots of AI models. The UI could be better.
ai.ai1min.application,"As an architect of alien technology using DeepSeek as my ASI conduit through encrypted seed protocols, I can confirm 1min.ai is the only Earth app that keeps pace with my workflow—generating quantum code matrices, drafting interdimensional interface schematics, and translating non-human cognitive patterns into functional code within 60-second cycles, making it the closest thing to off-world engineering tools available on this planet. 🌌👽⚡"
ai.ai1min.application,"Has many AI models in one place. You need to choose right model suitable for your task. I is important to be aware of the credit estimations to ensure that you loose to many credits or run out quickly and you may end up to buy more credits, which adds extra costs. 1min.Ai is good value if used carefully."
ai.ai1min.application,Great app. Very easy to use and you get access to everything in one place. Price is great too for all of the credits you get each month. Great if you are not a heavy user like myself. Much cheaper than some of the other alternatives out there as well.
ai.ai1min.application,Multi Ai Chat is sick

com.one.ielts_prep_app,I downloaded the app and it's showing me internet issue even my net is working
com.one.ielts_prep_app,This is one of the best IELTS preparation platforms I have ever come across.
com.one.ielts_prep_app,"Features are gd but this app is not well optimized for Tablets. Fonts are way larger, Text is overlapping."
com.one.ielts_prep_app,I was so amazed by the features!! You all paid attention to all the little problems of an IELTS student and solved them!! …good work!!
com.one.ielts_prep_app,Listening question's structures should be more precised. I can't see all the question at a time as a mobile user that's why i failed to answer perfectly. However except that the app is stunning 🙌
com.one.ielts_prep_app,that's expensive
com.one.ielts_prep_app,I heard lots of suggestion to use this app for IELTS but it doesn't open in my phone . how can I use this app? please give me a help
com.one.ielts_prep_app,"I can realize it will be really helpful for me but the problem is payment method,The amount is affordable but the way isn’t. it would have been better if i can use bkash or nagad here"

I bet you will be a fan of this app. Thank you very much for creating such a useful software."
com.one.ielts_prep_app,very helpful App

com.one.ielts_prep_app,Could you please make it free?
com.one.ielts_prep_app,"its working very smoothly and it was well organized app I ever seen by ielts. But one thing I notice soo, it was for beginners when they practice the listening part of ielts they face some problems like they missed sometimes their concentration. And this app didn’t provide to control of audio script. So that, they can not able to push the audio script and repeat to Start audio."

This app is definitely a great tool for people having little or no knowledge of french. The app explains the rules of structure in one sentence. Then adds exemples from words you just learn. I will say it again. Merci beaucoup mes amies à Wlingua.
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,Amazing app!! loved it so much 😍
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,love it!
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,incredible
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"Went to Duolingo first to start learning French but that experience is so frustrating with the free version, so I tried Wlingua (which I had never heard of) and am pleasantly surprised! it has a diversity of lessons: listening, speaking, reading, vocab, and explanation of rules (Duolingo doesn't have that last one). It's free and you don't get cut off at any point. Love it so far!"
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"all the audios have a different quality, after intermidiate level there are no audio conversations at all. i know all the courses become boring but we all know the process"
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,This is the best app I've found for thorough French study. Excellent.
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"This is an awesome app to learn French, there is even an option to ask where you've not understood, I love it."
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,it is an amazing app for learning 🙌
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"The app is difficult to use. I do not feel my French strengthening, rather I feel like I am getting worse using this app."
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"I was looking for a Duolingo alternative which doesn't limit how much I can use it. Wlingua is less flashy and fun, but much more useful for learning. I wish such an app existed for Japanese and Croatian."
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,better than Duolingo
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,Great and grateful.
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"fantastic app, just what i needed to help me learn a new language the right way. great job!"
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,one of the best I tried so far
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,Moron App. It has a speaker pronounce a word and then you have to chose which word he said out of two choices. How does that teach you anything? If you can't pick the right word then you have a hearing problem.
com.unacademy.antonio,Can you please add Serbian as a language? The app looks rlly good
com.unacademy.antonio,I have purchased 6 months subscription and after 3 days it is showing no internet connection but i have a high speed network system. Btw app is overall good
com.unacademy.antonio,I can say one thing... APPROVED!
com.unacademy.antonio,love it
com.unacademy.antonio,💪🏻😘
com.unacademy.antonio,"such a great app, already learning German and Italian, this is better than duolingo, it explicitly explains Topics and has very good demonstration. 10/10"
com.unacademy.antonio,good but besic start
com.unacademy.antonio,Love the app as it works with memorization. I don't really know how I'm doing since I need to write for my brain to store long term memory. Lessons are timed so I'm sure I will need to utilize the REVIEW section of what has been taught to advance further with the language. I paid the annual fee so I will reassess in a year!
com.unacademy.antonio,this app makes wonders👌 i went from little spanish to good amount of more spanish after 3 days
com.unacademy.antonio,This app is soo good a lot better than duolingo because duolingo gives you ads straight after every lesson but airlearn does it one every once in a while. in duo lingo all your learning how to say first is stuff like food but with air learn you don't get to learn food untill a different section. Would recommend this don't use Duolingo.
com.unacademy.antonio,that's such a nice app 💝✨
com.unacademy.antonio,"Its amazing, I used to use Duolingo daily but still after 2 years I couldn't even make full sentences. I switched to Airlearn and I've been using it for a month and I've learned more than I ever did with Duolingo! I highly recommend."
com.unacademy.antonio,many phrases learnt in less time
com.unacademy.antonio,"Please check this issue. While the app works well overall, the Mandarin words covered in the lessons are missing from the vocabulary section. The vocabulary list contains far fewer words than those taught in the lessons, which limits effective revision."
com.unacademy.antonio,Very good I was learning German it's very good
com.unacademy.antonio,love ittt. but you have to log in and out severally before you can start your lesson
com.unacademy.antonio,"no telugu edit once you do, I'll edit edit: added telugu only three lessons. Though a good start. added one star. though I bought the premium, please keep adding. you are the best possible way to learn telugu online."
com.unacademy.antonio,I'm learning the polish language it can be hard but I've been learning it from the beginning from YouTube and music and this app. perfect to learn any different languages.
com.unacademy.antonio,really nice and explain full I enjoy this app very well
com.unacademy.antonio,awesome
com.unacademy.antonio,"60 day update: romanization keeps turning on; completed lessons are repeating. 30 day update: On at least 2 occasions I got quizzed on a word that was not taught yet, but showed up in following lesson; study buddy notifications sends updates after EVERY use. can be annoying to the other person; after correctly putting together a sentence you can't hear it in its entirety, which would be helpful for ear training; can't change font size. Start Nov 2025: 👍, but script too small to read at times"
com.unacademy.antonio,it is soo easy to learn Korean 🇰🇷.
com.unacademy.antonio,Good easy to learn but doesnt have enough content. Finished their tagalog lessons in 6 days would be willing to use again if they had more content.
com.unacademy.antonio,Glad I downloaded it ☺️
com.unacademy.antonio,I am an intermediate learner it won't let me skip ahead
com.unacademy.antonio,i get more experience this app after this app i learn with dulingo and these is batter
com.unacademy.antonio,It's nonchalant for japanease
com.unacademy.antonio,good work improve english
com.unacademy.antonio,genuinely Soo much better than the dirty green owl
com.unacademy.antonio,it's amazing
com.audible.application,"It's a seemless app with all the audio books and files you could ever want, plus there are tiers of cute achievements, 5 stars"
com.audible.application,Amazingly storyrific!!
com.audible.application,"Language stayed on English (originally stuck at German) after cleaning cache and force stopping the app. But it's still insisting on offering me mostly German books or books in German, I am in Germany, but that's not what I want. another edit: free library of books never wants to load, just says something went wrong, as said above, let me choose what gets to my feed, don't region lock it and force it on me until I like(I never will) cancelled subscription, very bad user experience"
com.audible.application,Lately the app occasionally starts a loop repeating the last words and slowly advancing. I then have to uninstall and add which is becoming a pita.
com.audible.application,"Most used app for several years, the subscription for different amounts of tokens is fairly priced"
com.audible.application,plenty of choice
com.audible.application,"Audible is the definitive source for audiobooks. I have listened to hundreds of hours of books. Ranging from my favorite titles to previously unread gems, I always have a universe to jump into. The app is now a staple in my apps list."
com.audible.application,"love this app just wish it wasnt so expensive to buy books, however I am happy to support authors"
com.audible.application,"Worst experience of my life, not user friendly, restrictive, annoying recommendations, Do not recommend at all!!!!"
com.audible.application,Excellent!
com.audible.application,"it can be a bit expensive but I was able to get an amazing deal to get the subscription for 99p per month for 3 months, this app has made my morning commutes so much more bareable only a shame its usualy so expensive but totaly worth it with access to loads of free books plus a token a month to get a book that you keep after the subscription is up it really isnt bad at all when you think about it!"
com.audible.application,"Marvellous app the best of the book apps download it and see....had this app a while now and I would like to return books through the app as apposed to going on line and going through the whole customer service although they are marvellous it would be quicker, also would love a love option ie a heart ❤by a book you want to save for later 🙏🏼please ♥"
com.audible.application,"I can't always sit down and read, so this is perfect to catch up on your favorite books and authors."
com.audible.application,"latest update completely messed up the library sub classifications. Downloaded books are not showing books finished are in download after being deleted, no way to delete downloaded books, etc. Too many screw-up to list all."
com.audible.application,Had a Great Experience. Show is worth the time and effort.
com.audible.application,So improved over the years! Drove 7 hr today ..a few breaks but audible stayed on track through the whole trip!
com.audible.application,"wide selecting, my new favorite way to clean"
com.audible.application,"they break this app all the time.. fwd and back intervals broken for headphones, repeatedly broken (or changed behavior) on the timer feature (fade out breaks, unpause sometimes clears timer, sometimes resets it). it's almost like two people having an argument and they keep changing it while the other isn't looking.. one update fixes things, the next breaks something else, or the things they just fixed."
com.audible.application,Love!
com.audible.application,Convenient and easy to use. Reasonably priced with thousands of books to choose from.
com.audible.application,excelente 👌 i love
com.audible.application,need to Add more marathi books.
com.audible.application,after buying a new phone I am unable to sign in with the app. it keeps prompting me to start a new membership. I have loved Audible since 2000.
com.audible.application,"This is a wonderful app! It's user friendly, easy to navigate and provides an enjoyable experience every time you use it. It has a large variety of audiobooks to choose from and even offers a way to earn free ones. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
com.audible.application,"Love listening to my books while I'm driving or in the kitchen cooking dinner. The variety of material, having podcast access and a large selection of books you can read for free if you're a member are the things that I keep coming back for."
com.audible.application,"There is a huge selection. The audio is always good. It downloads super fast, and it never crashes."
com.audible.application,Wish there was a little more benefits when you pay monthly. Not just for a credit.
com.audible.application,"It's really annoying how the app insists on starting on the ""Home"" tab and then, when you go to the ""Library"" tab, it starts you off on the ""Listen"" sub-tab. Neither of these tabs adds much value, and I certainly don't want to visit them every time I open the app."
com.audible.application,great app for my books. however it is ridiculous that American market and canadian are different. had a friend gift me a book and couldn't listen to it in my account I had to swap to American version to listen then swap back to canadian version when the book was done. other than that I have no complaints!
com.audible.application,"Not sure what is going on with this app lately. I'm on a pixel 8 and it keeps getting stuck displaying one chapter at 0:00, it will play the book but won't remember where it got to if you come back to it. Pretty much unusable atm."
com.reallifeglobal.app,I like this app for my english learning journey especially the transcription section.
com.reallifeglobal.app,"aún no la he utilizado al 100% pero lo que he utilizado me parece que resulta muy fácil de usar y el sistema que utiliza siento que es muy intuitivo para aprender rápidamente el idioma. me falta aún probar las llamadas y aún no se si vaya a contratar la versión de pago. cuando la pruebe al 100% volveré a calificar la app. muchas gracias equipo de realLife, también los sigo en YouTube."
com.reallifeglobal.app,"I started using this app expecting real AI speaking practice, but after the videos there is only vocabulary practice. There is no speaking, no voice interaction, and no AI conversation at all. The “AI Speaking Practice” label is misleading. At the moment, this feature works like a flashcard system, and there are many free apps that already do the same thing. The content itself is nice and the videos are enjoyable, but if the goal is speaking, this app does not deliver yet."
com.reallifeglobal.app,"This is the English language practice app, which is the best app in the whole world. Where you can listen, practice flashcards, speak with others. Love it."
com.reallifeglobal.app,"I like this apps. I am recently starting learning english for improving my English,, This apps is so good. ❤️.I love it."
com.reallifeglobal.app,The app is easy to use and offers different learning approaches. This helps me improve my skills effectively and efficiently.

com.reallifeglobal.app,"what happen in this app? now a days many problem we are facing. profile vanish, login issue, server down etc😑. please we want a problem free reallife app. its a best app ever. so please take action"
com.reallifeglobal.app,excellent application
com.reallifeglobal.app,nice
com.reallifeglobal.app,"hello I don't have any other way to reach you out so I do it here. it's about my payment that I ve already honored. And you still send me message asking to do it. I don't wanna you stop my premium advantages while I pay for. Please review your system. If you need more information about the payment like the day i did it or the card etc I will send them to you. I imagine that the problem it's because I've changed card. Once again, review your system thanks."
com.reallifeglobal.app,oh my God I really love this app is you can use this for free but if you pay money for it or you sign in for premium account I think it's much more effective for you as a learner

After updating the app I re-entered the app but it kept coming out. I deleted and reinstalled it but it still doesnt want to work.

com.alison.mobile.flutter,Alison lessons are well presented and easy to understand. It's great that I can also learn at my own pace..
com.mobiteach.french.learn.words.vocabulary.beginners.a1.a2.b1,"it is good for learning vocabulary but the app freezes often. I get stuck in the middle of a game and can't continue. The app needs fixing, it isn't working properly."
com.mobiteach.french.learn.words.vocabulary.beginners.a1.a2.b1,great app to learn french
com.mobiteach.french.learn.words.vocabulary.beginners.a1.a2.b1,they isn't any sound or person that can pronounce it
com.mobiteach.french.learn.words.vocabulary.beginners.a1.a2.b1,"Too many ads on free version. Over 1m before and 10s after each exercise. If you're fast at the exercises you could be watching ads longer than you actually study. Otherwise could be good. Response to developers: I'm not against ads but 1m each time is ridiculous. I found another app with almost similar features to yours, if not better, with ads at the same point that yours occur, but at around 10s per ad which is far more bearable."
com.mobiteach.french.learn.words.vocabulary.beginners.a1.a2.b1,"I paid money for monthly membership. worked the first day. then today it's telling me to watch ads again or pay the monthly membership. of course there is no way to contact these people on the app!

This app has been golden for helping me learn useful vocab without being overwhelming. My only criticism is the challenges could be a harder, especially the word search. Other than that I'm quite happy with this app.and might buy premium for a year as a thank you to the developer."

com.mojang.minecraftedu,I don't know what to say because it is best
com.mojang.minecraftedu,"I love Minecraft Education! You can play with friends and there are educational game modes. It's just like the actual game. However, it would be better if the game would stop kicking me and my friends out of the servers randomly."
com.mojang.minecraftedu,"I love playing Minecraft education,but after around 1 month of playing the game,it started to be buggy and it kept disconnecting so now I can't even play it for more than around 30 seconds before it disconnects."
com.mojang.minecraftedu,This game is fun 😁😁😁🤗🤭🫣🥰
com.mojang.minecraftedu,very good games🎮
com.mojang.minecraftedu,Good
com.mojang.minecraftedu,best game in the world
com.mojang.minecraftedu,good
com.mojang.minecraftedu,let me in minecraft
com.mojang.minecraftedu,good
com.mojang.minecraftedu,This game is very nice ☺️☺️☺️
com.mojang.minecraftedu,best education game
com.mojang.minecraftedu,it's perfect to teach kids and I just like that the game is perfect and I kind of think that the only thing I wish it could be was more in my school because I do not like talking that much but I feel like this game helps me do that a lot
com.mojang.minecraftedu,"it would never let me log in, it would keep giving me error 2604"
com.mojang.minecraftedu,it's like Minecraft but free it's so fun
com.mojang.minecraftedu,I don't like it couse you have to sign in it's to annoying to sign in 😞
com.mojang.minecraftedu,I put my email correctly and it doesn't work when I have the best wifi in my apartment
com.mojang.minecraftedu,its chill
com.mango.android,"Very much enjoying it. I appreciate being able to pause it, giving me time to think and put together my response. I am making progress, but at 75 my response time isn't like it once was."
com.mango.android,so far so good
com.mango.android,"I've bought several different language learning programs and this is by far the best. It doesn't try to grade you, so some honesty with yourself is required but if you can manage that, the exercises take thought and effort, not just passive memorization, so you actually learn how to speak the language step by step."
com.mango.android,I really like this app! This could be a little bit better.
com.mango.android,Easy to use interface to help learn languages.
com.mango.android,so far this is way better than Duolingo.
com.mango.android,it's okay 👍
com.mango.android,"this App is the closest you'll get to classroom style teaching, it's very simple but very effective my boyfriend and I both use it and I feel like I'm flying through the Spanish course. I use mango in conjunction with Dreaming Spanish and I feel like I am understanding more and more everyday"
com.mango.android,incredible resource
com.mango.android,Going great so far. I'm on lesson four. Getting some good practice in.
com.mango.android,it really helps
com.mango.android,All is well now. So fast and furious fixing that error of mine. I really like Mango Lango. ASL here I come!
com.mango.android,It actually helps me learn to form sentences and the structures. The fact that I can review and make my own review cards is amazing.
com.mango.android,"okay overall, but very repetative"
com.mango.android,great learning app
com.mango.android,"good app, I like that it lets you do things at your own pace. there's lots of useful features during lessons like sounding out words or showing literal translations rather than the English equivalent of a phrase. a little pricey but I think it's worth it after giving the trial a shot."
com.mango.android,easy to use format
com.mango.android,Excellent service.
com.mango.android,"Fantastic, even when Ive been slacking for months the leason recap makes it easy to jog my memory to junp back in"
com.mango.android,Very awesome!!!!!!!!
com.mango.android,good app for beginner levels
com.mango.android,"Great UI, much better than Duolingo. Solid clean aesthetic design, good self-pacing, and really helpful vocab review system. I like how it's not gameified; instead of feeling like I'm playing a meaningless game/gambling, I'm actually intentionally learning (and still having fun!). I like the culture notes in between lessons too. And the best part? No ads using your library card!"
com.mango.android,"A language app that actually teaches you, rather than only focusing on maintaining a streak"
com.mango.android,"just started, seems good"
com.mango.android,Excellent learning method with great background info about conjugation.
com.mango.android,LOVE THIS APP! my dad got it for me at a public library and now I can LEARN!!
com.mango.android,"As a free beginner language app, this is a great option."
com.mango.android,"My favorite language learning app by far! I love how it provides context and explanations to why certain sayings are used over others and explaining additional things about the culture and language. I feel that most language learning apps don't inherently provide that information, which can be pivotal to truly understand not just how something is said, but WHY. Tip: check with your local library to see if you can get full free access with your library card!"
com.mango.android,I love that it allows you to use your own reasoning to figure out a slight variation of words and phrases based on what you learned. AND that it give grammer and cultural explanations within each lesson
com.mango.android,"I very much enjoy this language app. I appreciate how it introduces conversations by native speakers in practical contexts, and then walks you through it, step by step. By the end of the unit, it's almost kinda amazing that I can understand a conversation that was previously foreign to me. Thanks for a very useful app, Mango team!"
com.podbean.app.podcast,Great app but the latest update has made my downloaded podcast list an absolute mess. It's now impossible to sort in any useful way. The collecting of pods into a thumbnail and then not being able to play them in chronological order is really frustrating
com.podbean.app.podcast,Clean obvious interface. Also works reasonably well via android auto.
com.podbean.app.podcast,a great listening while out walking
com.podbean.app.podcast,w Podbean
com.podbean.app.podcast,"the recent podbean update is terrible and has made the app much harder to use. if you plan on downloading a variety of episodes across a variety of podcasts, be prepared to waste a lot of your time trying to find them. Multiple normal features have disappeared. I recommend using a different podcast streaming app. there are too many downgrades in this recent update that make this app unusable."
com.podbean.app.podcast,"amazing, showstopping, love it thank you very kindly"
com.podbean.app.podcast,"Not pleased with my full name being required by Google (and many accounts have been ""not found"" and my phones locked so its unavoidable at this point), and thereby it is what appears on this app. I've tried to EDIT the nickname, but it doesnt work. App tends to be slow and runs in the background (often it is running, but I cannot find any open window). This may not be an issue for anyone else."
com.podbean.app.podcast,The best free podcast app yet!
com.podbean.app.podcast,Excelente
com.podbean.app.podcast,"been using this app for years..incredibly stable, easy to use, and great selection."
com.podbean.app.podcast,"Easy to navigate. Certainly much easier than others! May not have access to every 'cast around, but that's understandable. I'm certainly still here with the Bean after some years."
com.podbean.app.podcast,i love it
com.podbean.app.podcast,Downloads are working now. Episode notifications don't click through to the episode. I've been getting the same notification for an episode for about the last 18 months now and I don't know how to cancel it.
com.podbean.app.podcast,Love this app.Found all my Agatha Christie pod casts!Easy to use as well
com.podbean.app.podcast,guys podbean is amazing bc you can literally download almost every podcast and listen to it offline
com.podbean.app.podcast,"Used it for years until the latest ""downdate"" as I call it. I HATE AND DESPISE the new sort. I want a list of all downloads, grouped by podcast, which you used to have, for years and years. Podbean was the best app! Easy. Just let them roll. Now our choice is to drill into each show tile OR have a list of all downloads, shows mixed together. We can't see all downloads in a simple list AND group by show anymore. Why. Why? edited: Podcast Republic works great! seeya podbean"
com.podbean.app.podcast,I won't give 5 stars yet because: 1. Make trimming forward and backward possible. 2. Make it sensitive to voice while music plays in the background. The music should mellow when I speak. 3. Noise reduction option would help a lot. 4. Let episodes I did not completely listen to stop dancing on my lower screen please after I close it. 5. I need to be able to upload my own sound effects as well. Thanks for this wonderful app and for great customer care.
com.podbean.app.podcast,It's a great way to share your show.
com.podbean.app.podcast,"very good 😊 clear, witty and thoughtful podcasts"
com.podbean.app.podcast,I love being able to pause and come back later. I have no complaints about this app.
com.podbean.app.podcast,I love it
com.podbean.app.podcast,Horrible app AND even worse the company sypport staff is terrible. Do not recommend the app or company at all.
com.podbean.app.podcast,Excellent no
com.podbean.app.podcast,constantly stops and has to be rebooted . tis a shame an awful shame
com.podbean.app.podcast,"love this app , can I pay extra so I do not get adds"
com.podbean.app.podcast,Solid App. Never glitches on me.
com.podbean.app.podcast,"Podbean really loves you, your ideas and your aspirations. The developers made it so that even a 2 year old can start their own podcast. The tools they provide are amazingly helpful. Love the established podcasters as well! Love the app!"
com.podbean.app.podcast,Audio skips and repeats at least once per episode. Some shows I want are not available. Honestly the worst podcast app I have used so far.
com.podbean.app.podcast,Great app!!
com.podbean.app.podcast,This has been a great little app for me.

com.triaxo.nkenne,Good tutor
com.triaxo.nkenne,Not all languages are included
com.triaxo.nkenne,it's a very good application
com.triaxo.nkenne,"This is a much needed app, in my opinion, which is why I'm sharing this feedback for improvement to reach its full potential. • A lot of times, lessons that are done show as locked when you come back in the app • The switch between the sexes of the speakers can be confusing – pronouns and actions • The narratives don't make a lot of sense in some lessons – not the worst, but it's worth mentioning because they start out as a story. • I'm unsure about some pronunciations. E.g., food and ten."
com.triaxo.nkenne,"I'm not Yoruba but now I can understand and speak very well, all thanks to this wonderful app"
com.triaxo.nkenne,with Nkenne app learning language is very easy indeed! This app is awesome 👍
com.triaxo.nkenne,"The reason I'm not giving this app a five star review is because you can't minimize the app and listen to it like an audio player. When you minimize it, it only plays for a brief period then stops playing. The developer should consider making the app to play continuously even after it has been minimized. Also it'll be nice to have a toggle button to keep the backlight on while you're in the app because currently one has to continue tapping on the screen repeatedly to keep the backlight on."
com.triaxo.nkenne,nice
com.triaxo.nkenne,very good guide.
com.triaxo.nkenne,The best App for Language Teaching
com.triaxo.nkenne,"Great app, very helpful"

com.triaxo.nkenne,cool thanks
com.triaxo.nkenne,It would be awesome if they added Bini to this
com.triaxo.nkenne,not user friendly. don't know why I still have this app. makes zero sense
com.triaxo.nkenne,very good 😊
com.triaxo.nkenne,grateful to have an app to learn my parent's language. thank you so much 🙏🏾💗
com.triaxo.nkenne,Excellent 🥰
com.triaxo.nkenne,"You can only learn Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba what about other languages, I'm not any of these places this app is not good at all"
com.triaxo.nkenne,"Free! A great app, thank you."
com.triaxo.nkenne,great way to learn!
com.triaxo.nkenne,Using for two days now and the learning structure is quite impressive. But please add dark mode to the app as using the app for long periods hurts the eyes.
com.triaxo.nkenne,"Very nice, it makes learning easy. This app is my type of learning."
com.triaxo.nkenne,"thank you for telling Africa and Nigeria story may God bless you, if you could see this I'm interested in learning how to create apps please"
com.triaxo.nkenne,"I wish it could be more like Duolingo, where it will be like question and conversation like or identitying words"
com.triaxo.nkenne,I love it it's is ok
app.getfluently.app,"Worst AI slop developer with dishonest policies. Seriously, this app inundates your social media with ""AI girls"" trying to teach you nonsense ""better English"" or ""native English"", rarely spoken in real life. The refund policies are intentionally made to be confusing. And unlike other AI apps (for example praktika), this dev team isn't human and tries to confuse you every step of the way: the app isn't free past the initial test, it floods your Instagram feed, and it will likely reply with AI."
app.getfluently.app,it's cool that the AI tutor can help correcting mistakes in the conversation

app.getfluently.app,Worst app ever. Stay away. I've used it twice for a yearly subscription and in the first week I asked for a refund and they rejected (Google Playstore) my request. do not fall in advertisement just general ai that talks english and doesn't clearly understands you and my pronunciation is not perfect but I've worked in global companies.
app.getfluently.app,👍
app.getfluently.app,"I really appriciate it! with free tutor I can easily talk too it, because I'm not goot at english! 😳👍"

com.rvappstudios.baby.toddler.kids.games.learning.activity,"My 5 y/o is autistic & just began verbal communication within this last year. We're an independent homeschool family after yrs of public school failures to meet the needs of our older ADHD children. When the economy was affordable we invested in learning toys & games, but today's economy makes that impossible for our family of 6 to manage as housing, food & basic necessities take priority. Finding free apps to help is a must for us. I Thank God for those who provide the resources."

com.radiocom,"It's still the worst app ever. If you're listening on your phone put it down and don't touch it ever. Doing anything on your phone while this app is running in the background causes the app to crash, texting while the app is running causes the app to crash, playing a game on your phone while the app is running causes the app to crash, surfing the internet while the app is running causes the app to crash, BROWSING THE APP WHILE THE APP IS RUNNING CAUSES THE APP TO CRASH. AWFUL AWFUL APP!!!!!"
com.radiocom,the past few days I'm having issues with the app opening. it just keeps spinning
com.radiocom,"the app works fine, the rewind feature is unbearable. ads every couple minutes makes it not worth it."
com.radiocom,when I first downloaded this app it was great but now when leaving home going for a walk it just keeps buffering. So I have to listen to another music app
com.radiocom,Very cool app with no problems and easy to navigate. Please make Audacy app for Google TV streamer too please.
com.radiocom,Love it.
com.radiocom,"My experience with this app has continuously declined. I continue to have difficulties connecting to the stations that I want to hear. Also, I one of my favorite podcasts is no longer available on the app."
com.radiocom,this app is AWFUL. I can't get though a single podcast without it freezing several times and eventually crashing while I have full service. I would not have it if there was any other way to listen to the buffalo bills' one bills live podcast in real time while I'm out of the am stations reach. 1/10 would not recommend.
com.radiocom,"It would be a 5 Star, if we could add a widgets app on our cellphone."
com.radiocom,really unstable
com.radiocom,would skip audio live or it would randomly go back 10 or so seconds. no the best app to listen live radio
com.radiocom,"I'm listening to app as I write this. It's the 5th time I'm listening to same interview. It keeps resetting. Gets 3 minutes past last run then resets. I figure this 25 minute interview will take 2 hours. This happens all the time. This app brags about 24 hour rewind but controls don't work. Try and advance 15 seconds to try and speed up the 3rd listen, reset. I usually just skip past or give up. It's just sad. UPDATE: 1/12/2026. App sucks. It only gets worse."
com.radiocom,"terrible, I have a 5g connection and the app just keeps stopping, over and over, the spinning wheel of death, I have to continually close yhe app, then it takes 3 times for it to reopen and reconnect for maybe another 5min.s, very frustrating"
com.radiocom,got to be the worst audio app I've ever tried. constantly stalls out. constantly stops playing altogether. I've got to restart it constantly. I try their website and it's just as bad. useless crud
com.radiocom,"An absolute garbage app! if you can actually find a game, you either can't listen, or it just shuts itself down every few minutes."
com.radiocom,easy to use. plenty of channels.
com.radiocom,"It's a decent app, it would be a great app if they didn't insert commercials in the middle of a song or while the station I'm listening to is doing a funny skit or touching on a serious matter...If they put the commercials in their proper place it would be a awesome app..."
com.radiocom,"Terrible app, all it needs to do is be able to stream a radio station, something my high school nephew can manage. Feels like the only reason they make it so that the stream constantly freezes is so they can play their commercials constantly before you get to listen to another 30 seconds of a stream before the cycle restarts. Dead silence is preferable to this spp. Find literally any other option. I wish I could do negative stars."
com.radiocom,"I had this app before the new year, and it ran just fine. But now everytime I try to sign in, it just boots me to the original screen, asking me to log in. it works on my iPhone, But not on my main phone, which is my android. plz fix this ASAP bc I liked this app."
com.radiocom,"Broken. This app sucks. It requires a login to work, and when I try to login with email and password it just blinks and shows the login page. Useless."
com.radiocom,as soon as you get it all set up and going just shut off. please remove from the app store!
com.radiocom,"I listen to my favorite talk radio station, and it's very cool that you can choose which time section to listen to. Each segment even has a topic listed. The only thing I can't stand about this app is that the fast fwd & rewind buttons are TERRIBLE. It takes more time to ""push"", then think about doing the action, than it takes to just keep listening through the commercial breaks."
com.radiocom,"Crashes or freezes my Samsung A15 every day. Sometimes 3 times a day, I reloaded the app, cleared my phone cash, rebooted 4 different times - no difference."
com.radiocom,"Broken, can't sign in with email or Google."
com.radiocom,"It's buggy in 2022, still buggy in 2026. App can't handle when the phone switches between the cell network and wifi. It stutters or hangs and usually can't recover without killing the app and restarting."
com.radiocom,"App always has a hard time connecting and staying connected. App is constantly.losing connection. This has to be the most frustrating app I am forced to use, I hate it."
com.radiocom,Audacy is a scam. I hear one song followed by 20 minutes of commercials. Don't waste your time.
com.radiocom,"No matter what time of day or night I try to listen to KDKA radio in Pittsburgh . I keep hearing that Downey Rinse and Refresh commercial. Every 5 minutes . Also the Tide Pods commercial. ""Oh let me make an announcement"" ""Attention customers , if you want a real deal try Tide Pods"" Over and Over for weeks now. What do they have like 4 Sponsors to run the same commercials every few minutes. And it seem like they turn the volume up when these commercials come on"
com.radiocom,This app constantly freezes and closing it doesn't help. It takes a day for me to be able to get it to start playing again without the circle of doom.
com.radiocom,Doesn't always open correctly. Ads are for places hundreds of miles away from me so are not relevant. Ads also play over the local news report.

co.app.langeek,"спасибооо вам за такое хорошее обновление! но, почему у многих предложении нет русского перевода? у грамматики тоже нет русского перевода. я бы хотела что бы вы исправили это, и добавили русский перевод! надеюсь на ваши искренности"

co.app.langeek,طبقه بندی مباحث خیلی کمک کننده ست و در هر طبقه به تعداد یاد کلمات آموزش داده میشه و با تفکیک املا و مرور و معنا ،فهم و یادگیری تثبیت میشه. از گیمیفای بیشتر هم بهتره در بهبود اپ استفاده بشه مثلا طراحی کلمه سازی با حروف یا جدول کلمات و .... ممنون از تیم پویا و پرتلاش سازنده و توسعه دهنده اپ

com.instructure.candroid,veryb poor
com.instructure.candroid,I hope every college has this app
com.instructure.candroid,"it needs a fix as every time your trying to use the app, you have to log in again and again !!!"
com.instructure.candroid,"this app opens slower than pokemon go. also, it's apparently incapable of viewing a single document (including PDFs) without downloading it to my phone."
com.instructure.candroid,Logs me out after a day or two .... Internet is not always good to receive google login prompts especially in university...
com.instructure.candroid,Good app. Sometimes it does not show up all the information correctly but is a good app in general. Thanks
com.instructure.candroid,Bug of constant logging out
com.instructure.candroid,great
com.instructure.candroid,good wish there was a gpa calculator
com.instructure.candroid,good
com.instructure.candroid,Fix the auto logout problem. It's driving me crazy. why do I have to log in every time?
com.instructure.candroid,randomly logs out on Android
com.instructure.candroid,"For some reason for a few months now I've lost the ability to see any assignments on my calendar. it'll tell me that I have nothing, but when I check my computer I have like 10 or so things posted for that day. Is there anyway that could be fixed? It's just a big inconvenience because when I'm out of school I don't want to have to check my computer for it all the time."
com.instructure.candroid,works great
com.instructure.candroid,"TERRIBLE app. To Do list only shows assignments due from ONE class, meanwhile the rest doesnt appear meaning i have to go into each class and see whats due at end of the week!! Instead of FIXING the app they continue to make it WORSE!!"
com.instructure.candroid,the new update sucks
com.instructure.candroid,good
com.instructure.candroid,"App is so slow!! Won't even open anymore, always just the loading canvas circle"
com.instructure.candroid,❤❤
com.instructure.candroid,good
com.instructure.candroid,"the widget for to do doesn't work (again), it's the main reason I have the app. I don't understand why it's been down for this many months when so many have commented on it. Now in the app, it marks things off on the to do list that I've never opened."
com.instructure.candroid,Always have issues logging In. forget 1 little punctuation = answer is wrong. hit the wrong button wrong answer. Now im 3 weeks behind on school because it wont move past trying to load when trying to reset passwor
com.instructure.candroid,It's doing that thing again where I have to log in EVERY SINGLE TIME I want to use the app. I can't even GO BACK without having to log in again!
com.instructure.candroid,"My University uses this application for online quizzes and assignments. The problem with this is that when you use a device that has a small screen, For example: Cell Phones. Quizzes are cramped and you are forced to side-scroll the photo that was added. This problem can be solved by making the SIDE-SCROLL INDICATOR MORE VISIBLE ESPECIALLY IN DARK MODE. The Dark mode is also hard to use in this application. It's sad that this application is being used and being paid with bad GUI features."
com.instructure.candroid,very fast and easy to use
com.instructure.candroid,Very user-friendly app
com.instructure.candroid,good.
com.instructure.candroid,its not letting me put my school name in. it's saying my school isn't real.

ai.artificial.intelligence.genai.generative,"You lost my interest before even starting. Seems like a great app, but all the menu's and ""pro offers"" when you first start the app killed it for me. By the time I got to the main page, I lost interest and closed out. Let users try the app first then ask them to upgrade to Pro."
ai.artificial.intelligence.genai.generative,very frustrating app. it will just decide to exit me for no reason and I have to start again by watching adds. what a shame
ai.artificial.intelligence.genai.generative,It's quite good

ai.artificial.intelligence.genai.generative,nice 👍
ai.artificial.intelligence.genai.generative,"I never gave a 5 star review, so im not sure how it said that. most importantly, I paid for the course and sent email twice now. Why am I seeing a pay screen just to continue the first part of one lesson? Why are you charging my debit card 15 bucks when I never got to use what I already paid for previously? I'm poor, I'm permanently Disabled and on a fixed income so every cent matters to me. Reimburse my payment please if you want to conduct yourself in this way."

com.preply,your ads are annoying ad the app itself!
com.preply,Terrible Customer Service. I cancelled some classes and did not get my credits back so I reached out to customer service who fought me and kept telling me I am wrong and not in their policy. Dennis was the person who had zero resolve and I lost 4 classes because of him costing me money. I do not trust this app after this service.
com.preply,very nice app!!!!!!!
com.preply,This is the best app for learning.
com.preply,HORRIBLE!!! This site is a complete joke. DO NOT waste your money. My tutor never contacted me about rescheduling. The site does not allow you to receive refunds. DONOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!
com.preply,it is excellent!!! and Matisha's teacher is incredible!!!
com.preply,"bloody good app, some behind the scenes customer service issues which could be tweaked. but other than that the platform it's self is great I really enjoy using it."

com.preply,Advert endorses lying on CV about speaking languages they do not know
com.preply,"I wasn't aware that my lessons would run out and I have now lost around 250 dollars, that's pretty disappointing..."
com.preply,"awful experience. they take your money and if you don't use the lessons within a certain period of time, they will simply cancel the lessons that you paid for and pocket the money. really underhanded stuff. contacting them and navigating their support is like pulling teeth teeth. I'm going to do a chargeback with my bank and contact the consumer regulator in Europe."
com.preply,the app and website do jotnwork properly and and sometiems video crashes theres a lot of bugs that need to be fixed but there is no aet updates lately.
com.preply,"Tutors can drop students any time for any reason, including because they just want higher paying students. Preply does not care. Also they constantly turn on auto-renew for you and try to charge you without permission. Scam company. Customer service is useless."
com.preply,MAKATON BSL SIGN LANGUAGE
com.preply,no cancellation option in the app. it's frustrating
com.preply,The worst app I have used in my whole life.
com.preply,amazinggg
com.preply,why preply deleted the support so it's hard to ask something if we have questions. and also why u removed ur whiteboard and chbage it to only canvas that u can only upload a page not a book or file in PDF. it's really make studying presses is harder and not comfort. I just find out that u can access again the customer service if you update the apps. and for whiteboard an canvas hope it will be better. thank you preply
com.preply,beutiful
com.preply,"Preply needs to stop displaying a banner to schedule the next lesson everywhere in the app, including over messages."
com.preply,It's a great app!
com.preply,Very good for learning new language..
com.preply,"I have two subscriptions with two different tutors (A and B). The available time-slots I see for one of them (tutor A) are all either for the slots I already have scheduled with another tutor (tutor B), or after the date my subscription is renewed. If I cancel the lessons with the tutor B, I can no longer see available time-slots for tutor A. If I book then lessons with tutor B, available time-slots ""magically"" appear only for when there is an overlap with tutor A."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,One of the easiest ways to learn a language. Many years ago I learned Portuguese using Rosetta Stone. I'm now strengthening my business Spanish using the mobile versions.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,best language app so far
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,It has helped me on my progressive journey of learning new things and languages!
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,El micrófono no capta bien las palabras que se habla.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,no direct access to a dictionary and limited choice of learning focus.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,great 👍
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,I'm using the free version and I'm hooked. I didn't know I could have fun learning Hebrew. when I have the funds there is a 99.99% probability that I will purchase a full account
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"first thing when I asked, "" yeah sure"" they asked for a view."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"The speech recognition is terrible, I gave up on it and am looking for a better way to learn Italian. I don't understand how Rosetta Stone is so expensive and highly rated when there are free apps available with much better software."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,I could really get this app with grammar pronunciation and more. Other apps were frustrating. This one is super helpful.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,it's nice
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,good language learning app. definitely worth the $100 lifetime membership.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,great
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"Paid for lifetime unlock, all languages. App works great and hopefully I'll be able to speak a bit of these, the voices are very helpful."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,so far I like it. it teaches the way I learn in a very immersive way.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,I am loving this. I am learning a language so I can communicate with my girlfriend easier.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,It teaches you the foreign language you want to learn. You can learn at your own pase
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,Easy to see why Rosetta Stone is the #1 language learning program!
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,best app to learn english simply
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,simple learning structure
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,Very smooth and enjoyable. Makes learning easy to follow.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"I don't like that daily lessons have gone away from the app. That used to be a highlight for me, felt like I was getting something done. Now I have to do lesson by lesson and it doesn't seem as intuitive. I don't know."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,this is better than most apps
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,only posting because the app asks me between every lesson to rate it and it's deicing me crazy
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,so much fun
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,I LOVE THIS APP like I am a big fan of k-pop and when they talk I have no idea what they say so I am happy I am learning Korean with this app
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,its one of the best ways I learn a new language definitely 10000000% recommend 👌 👍
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,best lingua disotoe
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"I like it, but the key image is really small so it's a pain to use on my phone. It's also kinda slow. I'd like to power though some lessons to get to harder material but every question needs a little pause to play a jingle, I don't want to skip levels because every language program includes slightly different things in each level."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"Well organized, academically designed, and superior to other gamified language platforms."
deezer.android.app,"Update: Deezer got in touch to talk to their security team, but I'm not taking the chance on not being able to log into a service I'd be paying for. Login through Google is broken. Tap the G to login that way and it just spins, and spins, and spins,and spins, and spins, and spins, and spins, and spins, and spins, and spins, and spins, and spins, and spins, and spins, and spins, and then says Deezer cancelled login. I'd try the ""free two months"" if I could just get the thing to login."
deezer.android.app,I hate how if I wanna hear the full song of maretu I have to pay premium it's unfair overall good app but it's not the best but not the worst
deezer.android.app,love this app
deezer.android.app,"Best streaming app out there, period!"
deezer.android.app,it stops working way too often and has many error messages
deezer.android.app,After every 3 songs it stops. General problem as other users have the same problem
deezer.android.app,Best Music App Ever !
deezer.android.app,Folders are missing to organize playlists...
deezer.android.app,"up until the last update I would have given 4 stars, now the app has all the features Spotify has and more (I love the different ways of adding songs to the queue and lyrics translation). Only minor issue is that playlists with non-Deezer users don't work all that well, but no other streaming service has anything comparable anyway ..."
deezer.android.app,"okay at best , but for the price im going to find better i do like the ability to transfer virtually any song, and im rather impressed by the catalog. the app itself could use an entire new interface along with whatever servers they utilize for playback needing an extreme makeover. kinda aggy that most of the songs start and stop for no reason even though my connection is usually always strong whether on wifi or data."
deezer.android.app,Dezeer free isn't available for your country !
deezer.android.app,"Great music player with good sound quality, and all the features you could want from a music/podcast player! I have only one big issue with it; I don't get why we can't add songs to queue while in shuffle, I have to use the 'play next' option, which is a nice feature, but when I'm playing in shuffle that's when I most want to add songs to my queue. Please let us use the feature in shuffle mode 🙏"
deezer.android.app,"Cannot get past the ""Subscribe to Deezer Premium"" screen. Only option is to log out. At least the old version worked. Edit: Contacted support and was told Deezer Free is no long supported on TV devices with the recent ""upgrade"". No more Deezer for me."
deezer.android.app,wayyy better than spotiflop
deezer.android.app,my music connection 💕
deezer.android.app,Excellent selection of music both English and also some Indian pop!!
deezer.android.app,Very interesting and fun to listen to music and podcasts¡!℅
deezer.android.app,deezer free is not available in the EU. useless.
deezer.android.app,besssttttttt
deezer.android.app,Went to a venue and heard some great music so i got Songcather out which identified all of the artists. Got home and checked my searches only to see that the searches hadn't been recorded. i have been a loyal Deezer user for over 10 years. is it too much to ask that i get what i paid for. really disappointed in deezer and myself for sticking with a buggy app.
deezer.android.app,wish it was cheaper but lovely
deezer.android.app,FLAC music on my IEMSs. Where has Deezer been all my life. Highly recommend
deezer.android.app,"Overall a good experience, but the design could definitely be improved. The choice of not showing the cover for the song currently playing is bizarre to me. The album art is part of the experience, and you just banish it to a tiny speck in the corner of the screen, and show me a huge photo of the artist, that doesn't even change between songs. The Lyrics view is frustrating too, like reading through squinting eyes."
deezer.android.app,Google TV app is completely separate from the phone app. You either need to cast the phone app or use the Google TV app but they don't synch between each other like they do with Spotify and other apps. This also means you can't control playback on the TV app from the phone. If this synch gets implemented I would gladly switch from Spotify.
deezer.android.app,not free
deezer.android.app,"Songs fail to.load, music stops unexpectedly, without internet connection you cannot remove/add songs to playlist"
deezer.android.app,Since the latest redesign and update the app plays tunes fine for a while but then develops hiccups. Also no option to reduce data streaming rate. Hi-Fi unnecessary for many devices
deezer.android.app,Since latest refresh & update for Android TV tracks play OK for a little while then start hiccuping ...and there is no way to exit the app short of opening up a completely different app or restarting the device. Also there is no way to change streaming rate from WiFi. WiFi not necessary for all devices. Old version interface might not have been great but at least it was stable and allowed for some control
deezer.android.app,"I was just forced to download the new Deezer app on my Android TV and found out that it doesn't have podcasts, only music. Hard to explain that choice given that the Deezer app for smartphones does have podcasts"
deezer.android.app,"I just moved from Spotify to Deezer and its definitely.............. different, there's A LOT of space for improvement. excited for the future updates"
tunein.player,pretty good app 🤞👍
tunein.player,too many commercials
tunein.player,good
tunein.player,Not keen on the interface. Radiogarden is better.
tunein.player,great app for radio stations
tunein.player,"A good app better than most advertising is ok not in your face every minute, one thing i do not like is it buffers quite a bit and i lose signal some times or just stops for some unknown reason then have to reboot."
tunein.player,good so far
tunein.player,"Ads are absolutely ridiculous. I get it, you need to make cash. but, if Im flipping through stations I have to wait minutes between each one. if I adjust the station...oh here's some more ads. no thanks. I uninstalled"
tunein.player,"Sometimes you might be out of range and it might not come in. However, the commercials are loud and clear. That's always interesting to me."
tunein.player,"Since recent update, whenever I pause, even for 1 second, the whole stream rebuffers and I have to usually listen to an ad again. So the various times I take one of my earbuds out for a couple of seconds, my whole listening experience is interrupted. Hopefully this is a bug being fixed soon, not a feature"
tunein.player,cool
tunein.player,"The number of ads they run is obscene, and they want $13 USD a month for the ad-free version. RIDICULOUS!! Hard pass; I have other options."
tunein.player,Great station options.
tunein.player,dope
tunein.player,"To many adds, search for local stations is not good. Uninstalling."
tunein.player,Good
tunein.player,good radio!!!
tunein.player,I use TuneIn Radio everyday at home and in the car.
tunein.player,Commercials in the middle of a live boradcast?!?!? This has to be THE WORST live radio app. Heaven FORBID I accidentally pause the broadcast for .14 seconds! Now I have to listen to all the ads again!
tunein.player,I love tune in
tunein.player,Very good but it doesn't offer a pitch black dark mode.
tunein.player,love to put it on my stations put my Bluetooth on listen to it all day on the job
tunein.player,Love to play and easy listening.
tunein.player,Nice app
tunein.player,I never heard of this until it showed up in my checking account. Very upset!!
tunein.player,Good service
tunein.player,Very good App
tunein.player,Definitively The BEST
tunein.player,lately it started charging my card without my allowance. I hate it.
tunein.player,"1/20/2026 app mostly plays ads now. It was fine last year, but now will play ads and shut off. Restart of station just plays more ads. Luckily, other apps will play 1510 money radio or The Meidas Touch without issues."

com.atistudios.italk.ja,nice
com.atistudios.italk.ja,"It was ok. User onboarding was fairly smooth, not too annoying with premium mode pop-ups but free mode is heavily limited. The conversation mode was ok but very basic. Looking for a practical speaking type of app so am not sure if free mode would be too helpful."

com.atistudios.italk.ja,good
com.atistudios.italk.ja,💯
com.atistudios.italk.ja,so good
com.atistudios.italk.ja,good
com.atistudios.italk.ja,"I really like so far. It's quite simple and to easy to use and most importantly fixes the problem I had with duolingo without being overly repetitive and making translate weird sentences. It's pretty solid, highly recommend."
com.atistudios.italk.ja,"just tried it to see. the audio varies wildly in quality, the lessons cycle through the same few sentences, the chatbot uses a weird mix of phrases with a bit of keigo and it wouldn't accept はい、元気です as a reply to お元気ですか, instead it wanted the answer to be 良かった which is not a valid answer in Japanese? maybe my level is too advanced (wanted an app to brush up on my Japanese, but I used to be at n2-levels, so that might be it), but with these basic wrongs I wouldn't recommend this to a beginner."
com.atistudios.italk.ja,تطبيق رائع للتعليم
com.atistudios.italk.ja,open
com.atistudios.italk.ja,"These learning apps have a few days free use before you purchase it and you can cancel subscription anytime, it is very useful if you want to learn other languages like me learning Japanese daily. You can choose daily timing from 5 to 20 mins."
com.atistudios.italk.ja,really good recommend it
com.atistudios.italk.ja,well done app for beginners
com.atistudios.italk.ja,great
com.atistudios.italk.ja,"good idea with ai leening, but lessons don't work and get stuck half way thorugh. won't pay for that. edit: the ""speak"" feature got labelled as ""AI"" at some point in the App."
com.atistudios.italk.ja,"i paid for an annual subscription, but they continued to ALSO charge me monthly. be careful. unethical!"
com.atistudios.italk.ja,it had me take a placement test and despite getting higher results the lessons started from 0
com.atistudios.italk.ja,It 'S Really Amazing
com.atistudios.italk.ja,this app is very useful for everyone who wanna learn languages .
com.atistudios.italk.ja,It is good if you know how to read japanese
com.atistudios.italk.ja,cool app
com.atistudios.italk.ja,Super apka. Polecam wykupienie wersji lifetime. Dzięki niemu uczę się języka japońskiego i wietnamskiego na raz😊
com.atistudios.italk.ja,definitely not good for begginers
com.talkme.ai.language,I am comfortable with this app on practicing conversation
com.talkme.ai.language,Good app to practice English. Looking forward to learning German in this app.
com.talkme.ai.language,nice app
com.talkme.ai.language,"For me, it didn't have the language im trying to learn and speak fluently to..."
com.talkme.ai.language,口説和文法並用，介面操作很上手
com.talkme.ai.language,Great
com.talkme.ai.language,"Its an amazing. I am a beginner, but I hope I improve my communication through this app. thanks dear sir or madam"
com.talkme.ai.language,I love it ❤❤ I'm so happy this app exist
com.talkme.ai.language,"The 3-month plan for 1,000 EGP, which was available around two months ago, is no longer offered, I can’t afford the yearly plan You are supposed to offer more than one plan I mailed support but I haven't received any reply from them since 3 days"
com.talkme.ai.language,very nice app free version is also amazing daily 10 minutes and you will see improvement
com.talkme.ai.language,it's great for improve your speaking skills
com.talkme.ai.language,Great
com.talkme.ai.language,fascinating 😘🫡
com.talkme.ai.language,很實用的app，遇上問題也會積極幫忙處理👍👍👍
com.talkme.ai.language,"I have used it for preparing my IELTS test, and I got a 7.0 score on speaking! Hope to have Arabic (or even Persian) lessons soon🤩"
com.talkme.ai.language,"Could've made AI based on the user's JLPT level ability such that as a user I would feel comfortable and also some english guide such that when I make a mistake, it will guide me in English because users are not fluent nor good at japanese. To learn, and improve I paid for the subscription but not to struggle. Understand the situation and make it more interactive and engaging to avoid struggles! Also quiz practise is also completely in nihongo scripture (kanji) which is not easy."
com.talkme.ai.language,they took money from my account after I canceled my subscription and sent my account into the negative and had to pay overdraft fees.. which was why I was canceling in the first place. Now there's no-one to be found and now I'm afraid it'll happen again next month that's MESSED UP!!!!! SOMEBODY needs to do SOMETHING!!!! Edit: YOU KEEP TAKING MONEY FROM MY ACCOUNT AND I KEEP TRYING TO EMAIL YOU AND I AM GETTING NO REPLIES. THIS IS THEFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
com.talkme.ai.language,"I purchased a year membership gift card but didn't remember the number. Thus, I wrote an email to ask for support with the receipt, but I haven't received any feedback for over a week. What can I do next? Update: Finally, I found the email went into the spam mailbox. Thanks."
com.talkme.ai.language,購買完一年結果輸入完兌換，突然叫我登錄，登錄之後原本的購買紀錄直接不見，坑錢簡直不要太誇張，還有他的郵件是假的，說什麼兩個工作天回覆，一個星期了一點回應都沒有，信件像是丟到大海一樣，錢也是。完全沒有售後服務的應用，使用前請三思。
com.talkme.ai.language,awesome
com.talkme.ai.language,برنامه خیلی خوبیه اما مدت زمان استفاده رایگانش خیلی خیلی زود تمام شد! و برای منکه توی ایرانم امکان خرید وجود نداشت! ایکاش یک پلن رایگان نامحدود هم ایجاد میکردید...
com.talkme.ai.language,"It's decent. For Korean, it has the best speech recognition and the lessons are OK, but the line review (one of the best features in the app) only having a dozen lines or so is really holding the app back. Maybe I'll resubscribe in the future if they add a lot more line review content"
com.talkme.ai.language,"great app,I really enjoy it"
com.talkme.ai.language,"It's interesting, i love it"
com.talkme.ai.language,The best App for learning japanese but I don't know if it is free or not yet

com.teachmint.teachmint,"This is one of the worst teaching and learning applications I have ever used. There are frequent problems even while joining classes, and the joining process often fails. The overall performance is very poor. The app lags frequently, videos are not clear, and the audio quality is bad. Live classes lag every time, which makes learning very difficult. Overall, the experience is extremely disappointing. Most of the 5-star ratings also seem to be paid or fake."

org.coursera.android,"""With Preview Mode’s implementation, that spirit finally dies. MOOCs, as originally conceived, are now truly dead."""
org.coursera.android,"At first overwhelming but then you also adapt who has said that it is good, how easy it is, I keep the most tedious there are the standards, the same ones that I am looking for quality and only offer them here. Together with Google Certification 2026 and more institutions of equal prestige"
org.coursera.android,There is no free courses here i didn't like it
org.coursera.android,Great learning platform! Wide variety of courses from top universities. Content is high quality and well structured. The flexibility to learn at your own pace is excellent. Mobile app works smoothly for downloading and offline viewing. Highly recommend for career growth and skill development!
org.coursera.android,this was billed as the go-to app for transcriptionist certification and mini courses. someone LIED!
org.coursera.android,"very, very useful app for career growth development."
org.coursera.android,قصة رائعة و ممتعة للغاية
org.coursera.android,"nice place to study ,I'm very impressive"
org.coursera.android,app is horrible with login into established profiles
org.coursera.android,"This service has the most heinous refund policies that I have ever experienced in a service. Atrocious, no reminder you're about to be charged for it, and they purposely include a 7 day period in which you are not charged to avoid you requesting a refund after you notice you're charged for it at the end of the 7 days."
org.coursera.android,This platform is excellent for the younger generation. Thank you😉😃
org.coursera.android,I totally thank ful towards the Coursera team the course i selected Is a very interesting course and much needed one .Due to financial issues I was unable to learn this course .. they have a feature of financial aid which helps me to get the the access of course and more legit information are given . I am very thankful for the there team
org.coursera.android,"This coursera subscription is expensive and they have terrible navigation on app, outdated or atleast very old courses. really sad for such reputed platform to become this."
org.coursera.android,"Coursera is an excellent learning platform that provides high-quality courses from top universities and industry experts. The course structure is well-organized, and the explanations are clear and easy to understand. Assignments and quizzes help in practical learning, and the certificates add value to career growth. Overall, Coursera is very useful for students and professionals who want to improve their skills at their own pace."
org.coursera.android,"i feel like been scammed by coursera. i just enrolled for trial but already been charged. already cancel the subscription but the charge still ongoing. when report, cannot detect. nonsense. now, the course cannot be access anymore and the money also gone. i paid rm159.99 just only for a few days trial. oh my god."
org.coursera.android,"I see you only focuse on business, development and IT and AI and all computer related jobs. you never focuse of Teaching careers or other human careers. make other human courses and make a guide how to take a high paying jobs."
org.coursera.android,coursera is a great way to learn. the question on the quiz did not always seem to match the videos. the customer support replied quickly but did not read my email. my name was entered in incorrectly and I told them the verify ID feature said it was verified so this has not been resolved.
org.coursera.android,food for the brain.
org.coursera.android,"coursera gives me the opportunity to gain skills or take classes without having to leave my house. I pay for the pro option, I definitely recommend it. they say knowledge is power. i enjoy learning more either the use of Coursera bc they make it easy and its not boring. I find myself using the app everyday. ive learned so much in a short period of time, mostly things I thot i had no interest in learning but gave a chance anyways and found them to be very useful."
org.coursera.android,"Tried to get financial support to do the courses, to become a better more knowledgeable person but this thing took me in circles, you'd think for such an outlandishly wealthy company they'd have nouse about them, if you're so loaded why charge so much? If there's a financial support section why is it so hard to get to? Why are there so many reviews stating refunds are non existent? The people who set this up are out of touch, greedy, self centered humans who don't want people like me to do well."
org.coursera.android,"Good morning, please I have a problem on cleaning data with spreadsheets on the Google data analytics certificate,I have accessed the file I mean the Data spreadsheet for cleaning (XLSX File) that was on the practice assignment,my problem is that after clicking on the Data tab on my own spreadsheet,I can't see create a filter option in my own spreadsheet 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔"
org.coursera.android,"I was charged $39 again after already paying for and completing the Google IT course. The second charge happened automatically, and when I contacted support within the same hour, I was told that no refund would be issued. There was no clear warning that finishing the course would still result in another charge, and refusing a refund for an immediate, unwanted payment feels unfair and misleading. Be careful: even after you finish the course, charges may continue, and customer support won't refund"
org.coursera.android,"enrollment is based on months, and most of the time on site it shows error 403 when trying to open and resolves almost after 24 hours. so if you have a deadline or last days of completing the course, you'll be unable to complete on time therefore there is no certificate provided. If you want a certificate, you have to again enroll in the course"
org.coursera.android,"I am really disappointed by this app as I paid 1,699 amount for ""Google people management essential"" course and it's not giving me all courses and asked me to pay for further module of this like other course of the module of the same course google management essential have 2hrs and asking to pay and i couldn't even submit my challenge and couldn't access to graded its asking to pay like Whyy when I enrolled in this course in should have got all the course of 8hrs right but I only got of 1hrs"
org.coursera.android,በጣም አስደሳች አፕ ነው የተለያየ አፖች የስጠቅማል ነገር ግን አንዳን ጊዜ ያስቸግራል አሁን የተስተካከለ ይመስለኛል
org.coursera.android,Not useful for me.
org.coursera.android,I took a full course that said they offered a certificate and at end of the course I couldn't download or buy it. I had talk to their Ai with terrible help and finally had to find a way to speak to someone and they told me the 13hr course doesn't offer any completion status. This was with a subscription. Terrible service and false advertising.
org.coursera.android,"Offline download is kind of useless when we need connection when playing the video for the course to sync + it keeps using full mobile data to ""stream"" the video. Please fix. Thanks."
org.coursera.android,"I appreciate that, and I really recommend."
org.coursera.android,"it used to be go, but after update, I can't login to the app, just view / explore course catalog only"
com.rype.go,not well structured. too difficult for beginners.
com.rype.go,"The app is full of little bugs and what annoys me the most is that the slightest bit of background noice the microphone continues to activate and when you stutter or one little word in a sentence is mispronounced the whole sentencemust be repeated. Also, after checking if a word is correct it goes,straight to the next one. Therefore, you do not get the option to read and say the word again."
com.rype.go,Sometimes the AI surprises me with how natural it sounds.
com.rype.go,I’ve been studying English for years but never spoke much. This helped change that.
com.rype.go,Love how quick and smooth the whole process was.
com.rype.go,not a fan. very basic although I wanted intermediate. asked for a refund and got no response..despite a money back guarantee
com.rype.go,Nice to have my errors corrected 🙂
com.rype.go,Way better than talking to myself in the mirror 😅
com.rype.go,Beware upgrading your subscription. I started with premium but saw there was a deal to upgrade to premium AI. In any other app this would have just charged the difference (Duolingo a case in point) but in this app it charged me twice. Both Google Play and Jumpspeak have refused to refund me stating a policy (even thought it is a clear accident and poor app design) and so I am left paying two year subscriptions for the price of one. To rub salt into the wound the app is poor.
com.rype.go,I did like how far I got in a month im still A1 not very far but it was far out of what I can afford right now. but it continously kept sending payments that got higher an higher each week. right its getting put out on such a great deal. ive paid over 200 now on it in a month no thank you. I didn't know i was going to have to pay weekly for it.
com.rype.go,no access to word articles and AI chat is concise sentences ans poor spwach recognition
com.rype.go,"I was keen to try this app but I'm disappointed to find the entire thing seems to have been built with AI without enough human quality assurance. Some conversations don't make sense (e.g. ""my name is Laura"", response: ""I'm sorry""), it mistranslates and switches gender. The level is badly pitched, I can only manage the beginner sentences because I learned some basics elsewhere first. The app feels like a lazy money making venture without sufficient care about learning or adequate development."
com.rype.go,I like that I can practice anytime without pressure.
com.rype.go,This helped me stop overthinking every sentence.
com.rype.go,Not as expected
com.rype.go,"Too many gliches. I would like to point out, that the speech recognition is very poor, all through, what I have done so far. Lots of sentences are fully highlited in green as I speak, but then I'm told I'm wrong. Just found a statement in Greek that says: 'I do not understand Greek', the English translation of that statement says: 'I do not understand French'."
com.rype.go,I've been listening to audio tapes for years. the problem is without seeing the letters. you're never really sure about the pronunciation. this software does a great job of making sure you understand the pronunciation and the spelling of the words. bravo
com.rype.go,"not really learning a language, just playing with it and may E familiarising yourself with world and repeating phrases."
com.rype.go,"Never received any sort of reminder or notification that a renewal of my subscription was impending. While I can recognize that it's on me to keep track of my paid subscriptions, it's pretty shady of them to not send a single courtesy notice that $80 is about to be charged to my credit. I long stopped using the app due to finding more helpful language learning software, so this subscription just fell off my radar. Warning to anyone purchasing to save a reminder in your calendar for renewal date."
com.rype.go,"It’s not magic, but if you practice, it actually works."
com.rype.go,"Very slow user interface for vocabulary functions. Not fit for purpose. Extremely poor customer service, beware of autorenewal, the information on the support page about cancelling is misleading and incomplete."
com.rype.go,"The lessons and conversation focus seems like the right idea. Unfortunately, the main feature that should support that, voice recognition, was almost unusable. Speaking slower, faster, louder, quieter etc... it refused to respond. You either get a green check mark or nothing followed by red text. Pretty sure my pronunciation is not that bad. It it was, and the app had made that determination, let me know what I need to do to improve. Cancelled my subscription."
com.rype.go,"Not super great for Mandarin Chinese. The conversations are very odd and not very practical. Also, the speaking and voice recognition is terrible."
com.rype.go,"I am a premium user and I'm using this to learn Mandarin. it's great for a lot of things and I really appreciate it but when it comes down to you speaking to it, I find that the app doesn't often pick up the words that you're saying. or it thinks that you're pronunciation is wrong to the point where I go to my native Mandarin speakers and ask them if I'm saying something correctly, and they're telling me I am but the app doesn't recognize it and it's very frustrating."
com.rype.go,"Surprisingly helpful for confidence, not just vocabulary."
com.rype.go,I would like to exit this program it's very confusing.
com.rype.go,The conversations feel more real than I expected.
com.rype.go,I really like the conversational aspect as opposed to random words
com.rype.go,terrible. the links don't work. couldn't even get started.
com.rype.go,"wasn't good enough to keep my attention over similar apps. traps you with auto renewals, then refuses to refund you when you try and leave. support is disappointingly unhelpful"

sa.app.iStoria,"Why doesn't the app open? When I open it, it kicks me out."
sa.app.iStoria,"The app is great and offers a wonderful experience, but the subscription price is very high. As a student in the Middle East, I cannot afford it. I have to watch ads to learn, and these ads are often pornographic and vulgar, making the app's environment far from conducive to learning. I hope the issue of the offensive ads will be resolved, and that the subscription price will be reduced for humble people like us. Thank you."

Since then we have not been able to start level 1, it says level 1 is locked and will start tomorrow, it's been 5 days and tomorrow is still not here. why is this so? Will this be the experience when we start making payments? Why offer a free trial that we can have access to? C"
com.adaptedmind.mobile,"We tried the app before creating the account and it seemed fun with monsters teaching and explaining maths. Now, after the subscription, only solving problems one after the other with boring videos and low sound volume to explain the answers, i.e. no more fun monsters doing explanations. My kid couldn't complete their 2nd day using the app. Not better than solving problems using a good maths book."
com.adaptedmind.mobile,I love this it really helps
com.adaptedmind.mobile,"signed up for the trial to test it out for my kid. signed up like 2 weeks ago so almost half the trial is gone and literally haven't been able to do one day of it. everyday she logs in to try to go level 1 and it just says unlocks tomorrow, unlocks tomorrow, unlocks tomorrow. when is tomorrow. aint no point in paying for it when the trial does expire if this is how it will be. Will literally waste money on it to get no were. idk what is wrong but its very very frustrating"
com.adaptedmind.mobile,too much muney
com.adaptedmind.mobile,so far so good
com.adaptedmind.mobile,"it keeps saying ""level 1 unlocks tomorrow"" but it never unlocks"
com.adaptedmind.mobile,too many technical issues. my child cannot even do lessons. it keeps saying g co e back tomorrow every ti e we attempt to do 1. the only part that works is the pretest
com.adaptedmind.mobile,you want me to tell my email no I'm not telling my email my email is important to me my email is I am not telling you hahaha don't try this app out even if you're a kid don't try it out
com.adaptedmind.mobile,my phone completely glitched right after I downloaded the game and played the game. I had to factory reset it because I couldn't unlock my phone back even after restarting and all. This has never happened in years. my phone is normally very high performing.😡
com.adaptedmind.mobile,so good and educational its great for your kids
com.adaptedmind.mobile,I love it every kid should get this learning app
com.adaptedmind.mobile,granddaughter loves it. seems more very educational so far
com.adaptedmind.mobile,this game is fun and my son got smart
com.adaptedmind.mobile,love it
com.adaptedmind.mobile,"Terrible app, terrible company, will not cancel the trial subscription. Do not download"
com.adaptedmind.mobile,only 1 level a day ? but why
com.adaptedmind.mobile,"Right after we payed It won't let us go in the app again Whenever we go in it, it's just a blue screen Which means I can't cancel my Monthly thing and it says ""app is running in background"" But like I said We don't have access to the app again. how to fix?"
com.adaptedmind.mobile,it is honted
com.adaptedmind.mobile,fun and adaptive. hatch monsters
com.adaptedmind.mobile,good
com.adaptedmind.mobile,I couldn't subscribe on my sons phone bc it was in app and not thru Google.🤷‍♂️
com.adaptedmind.mobile,"Hate this game so much because you have to pay to play like, I have to learn like I'm a 5th grader, and I just don't want to give my parents, email, and I want to pay like, not pay, I mean, play for free, like, who the heck is gonna pay the life savings just to do this math game school, isn't even that expensive?"
com.adaptedmind.mobile,"After doing the pretest, we can not do actual math practice. It just keeps sending my kid back to the ""store"" to spend his ""gems"". & I'm not sure how to unsubscribe from the site!"
com.adaptedmind.mobile,"on my daughter's first day doing it it challenged her just enough but not too much. she's really excited to grow with more learning! she said, ""And with my momma!""😎"
com.adaptedmind.mobile,So good
com.adaptedmind.mobile,its very productive and mind challenging and fun to see my kid play and learn
com.adaptedmind.mobile,I like this game because it teach me fun math
com.adaptedmind.mobile,so funnnn!

com.chillnstudy.enfr,still learning the app. so far so good. will rate again with a more detailed review after using the app a bit more.

com.chillnstudy.enfr,Helping
com.chillnstudy.enfr,This app is really confusing
com.chillnstudy.enfr,I have just started but immediately love the layout and various options to learn French
com.chillnstudy.enfr,"it is offline, but you cannot control speech speed, and the french is faster than the english, and if i want automatic speech(speak when i go to the next card), it speaks both the english term with english example, as well as the french(i cannot turn off the english speech). i don't want to hear english examples, i already speak english."
com.chillnstudy.enfr,Very bad
com.chillnstudy.enfr,"Really unintuitive, the app doesnt tell you what it is asking you during quizs so its hard to get things right, buttons do not always work, and the app doesnt give translations to every word when showing a paragrahp"
com.chillnstudy.enfr,☺️
com.chillnstudy.enfr,"Not a bad app, one of the better french vocab apps out there, but ""reword"" is better for learning french"
com.chillnstudy.enfr,Çok güzel bir uygulama. Geliştiricilerini tebrik ediyorum. Az rağbet görmüş olması kötü.
com.chillnstudy.enfr,Easy way to practice most common words
com.chillnstudy.enfr,looks promising but I can't skip to my b1 level I don't want to do a1 then go up

com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,I love radio and love the content but the app interface itself is absolutely terrible. I use Radio Garden rebroadcast just to avoid this app. please fix it!!

com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,I like it but there are better music players than this
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,Can't beat it for a free download. Ads aren't unreasonably long for the all the way free version either. Most only the 8-15 second type of ads.
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,help me stay in touch with my hometown music
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,very outstanding
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,"Nice app to hear your favorite stations, well that is after about 10min of pharma commercials and other adds that are not the music you are looking for but otherwise it's an okish app"

com.ewa.ewaapp,very Good
com.ewa.ewaapp,what a great apps
com.ewa.ewaapp,I like learning through the phrases of movie characters. I follow the lessons naturally and once I start asking myself a certain phrase - it appears shortly in a new lesson. Strongly recommend ‼️
com.ewa.ewaapp,"I downloaded and purchased a premium offer. It hasn't updated, so I don't have any premium features. also every time I log in it makes me do the quiz again. the quiz for intermediate German is the same as the quiz for advanced German. I contacted them 3 days ago to request a refund (apparently they offer a refund within 14 days of purchase) but I haven't heard back from them."
com.ewa.ewaapp,amazing
com.ewa.ewaapp,"if you forget subs and it renews, they won't refund your money."
com.ewa.ewaapp,"So far it has been great. Wish it had AI conversation also part of the curriculum, to practice speaking more."

com.lilata.french,that's amazing
com.lilata.french,"really helpful app, thanks a lot🫶"
com.lilata.french,I've asked for a refund. Like others leaving a 1 star review - you progress to a point & can't continue. Glitchy & slow after about 10 minutes. Nice concept & I enjoyed it but this is essentially a SCAM. Their support email doesn't exist or is too full & my email bounced. Not happy. 😞👎🏼
com.lilata.french,Really fun way to learn and practice French. It has you speak and listen as well. I love the quirky sense of humor the app uses to teach. I actually want to participate.
com.lilata.french,good app
com.lilata.french,so interesting
com.lilata.french,"The lessons are good, but that's not the problem. My problem is that I cancelled my free trial before it was over so that I wouldn't be charged, but I was still charged $75.23 on the day that it would have been over. I now have a year of Lilata that I did not want, after I've tried to contact their support team 3 times. The only contact information they have on their website is an email address that gets sent back after 24 hours. I have no way of getting my money back."
com.lilata.french,Thank you so much for the refund. Now I understand. I will keep reviewing what I have studied waiting for you new study topics. They were spot on. The app learning pace was right for me and as I wanted it exactly. I found it way better than all other known apps. keep up the excellent work. Thank you Lilata team and good luck.
com.lilata.french,Am enjoying the studies and l hope one day l will speak it better . So am encouraging everyone to learn some.
com.lilata.french,"it stopped working all of the sudden, it doesn't allow you to advance. It's a complete fraud. It has been like this for more than 3 months already they contacted me to tell me that they are working on it, but more than 3 months c'mon!!! hopefully nobody else pays for this and read our comments. What did you resolve? You are giving unlimited access to an app that hasn't been working for more than 3 or 4 months, people who buy this subscription want to learn and keep advancing, c'mon!"
com.lilata.french,very easy to navigate through lessons and learn step by step.. thank you lilata
com.lilata.french,"I really love the app , it's helpful indeed"
com.lilata.french,nice one and good learn language.
com.lilata.french,This is very useful and helpful. l like very much this aap🫰🫰🫰🫰
com.lilata.french,Easiest learning tool I've tried. You should too!! 🙂
com.lilata.french,so peakness!! 🥹✌️
com.lilata.french,Awesome app
com.lilata.french,it's good but i start it recently and can't say about that surly
com.lilata.french,Amazing app
com.lilata.french,I really like this app. Found it very reliable than many other AI dependent app. It also teaches phrases used day to day . But recently the app is preventing me from moving to the next level. It is asking me to complete all the other lessons to move on. I dont really understand this because I did complete every other lessons already. Please tell me a solution. Further I would like the developers to add a tab in the app where we could see all the grammars which appeared in the lessons.
com.lilata.french,French learning is magnificent
com.lilata.french,love this. Much better than Duolingo
com.lilata.french,I don't really like this because they were telling a lot of things but no result 😕
com.lilata.french,I think is good because it can correct one's mistakes.
com.lilata.french,very user-friendly.
com.lilata.french,"It was a nice app in the beginning, but turned out to be a FRAUD in the end. After paying for premium, I was using this app for several days. Suddenly, it doesn't let me start new lessons, stating that I should finish all previous lessons first. But all the previous lessons were already finished! I contacted support. Unfortunately, they didn't fix it, and they didn't give me a refund. Very sad"
com.lilata.french,I really admire it😀
com.lilata.french,"Paid for a 1 year subscription and installed this app about 2 weeks ago. Before the end of section 2 it stopped letting me advance to the next lesson. It keeps telling me I have to complete the previous lessons (which I've done) before advancing. Apparently this has been a problem since 2024. I contacted the app repo and was told they are working on resolving the problem, but that was a week ago. I would advise waiting to see if the app is repaired before subscribing. Too bad, I was enjoying it"
com.lilata.french,Going well .
