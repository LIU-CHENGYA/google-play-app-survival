Academic research has found that memories are formed by repeated exposure to new information, so Magoosh’s flashcard app uses a spaced repetition system. Words you are learning will reappear frequently (occurring less frequently the better you know them) and words you already know won’t be repeated. The GRE word list is culled so that you focus on only the most important words.


Your practice will focus on the words that you need to review the most to make sure the words you learn will really stick.


What is Magoosh?

<b>Only 10-15 minutes per day</b> Spending just 10-15 minutes every day, will easily allow you to remember all useful French words. While memorizing words, the frequency of lesson is more important than duration of each lesson. 10 minutes on each day of the week will be more productive than one hour of tuition a week.

<b>One minute lessons</b> Taking into account busyness of modern life, we designed each lesson in the way so it would never take more than one minute to complete it! So you no longer need to search for free time to practice French! Simply, once you get a chance, launch the app and do one lesson at a time =)

<b>Only useful French words</b> French for Beginners: LinDuo HD is a free and quick start to learn French language! Unlike others, we have only the most useful words, which are divided into 180 topic based lessons. Quality is here!

Teach-yourself French is designed, that it will use your visual and echoic memory to help you memorize French words fast and easy!

<b>Word pronunciation by native speakers</b> Our app will help you master pronunciation of French words! Each word is recording by professional native speaker! Additionally, in the settings you can choose between male or female voice.

<b>Dynamic lesson difficulty</b> The app changes lesson difficulty gradually as you progress. To achieve this, it keeps stats for EVERY word! Example: in the spelling mode, initially you need to insert several missing letters in a word, then create a word having extra letters and finally, when you are ready, you will need to type the entire word on the keyboard.

<b>Modes for quick learning</b> The App includes four additional lesson types which are made of Favorites, Difficult, Old, Random words. You can add any word to your favorites and later create custom lesson from your Favorite words. Words are automatically added to ""Difficult"" (the ones you struggle to memorize) and ""Old"" (which you have not reviewed for a long time) sections. A ""Random"" mode will create a unique lesson.

<b>Do not need to know how to read</b> If you cannot read yet, no problem! Each word has a transcription in your language! And for more experienced ones, in the settings, you can choose a phonetic (like in a dictionary) transcription.

<b>Additional features</b> Thanks to your reviews, we are constantly updating the app to make it better! To help you take care of your eyesight, with just one tap, you can activate dark theme. If you temporarily do not have internet access, no problem! The App can work offline as well!

<b>Review Past Material</b> Many good apps do not pay enough attention to review past material! For this purpose we created the word game ""True or False"". It is very simple, but it's addictive and the most importantly, it helps to repeat past material and never to forget it!

<b>Support and Contact Us</b>
If you have any questions or suggestions, please never hesitate to send us an email <b>admin@lin-duo.com</b>!

About the developer

My name is Sam and I am an Academic English teacher. I have found that my students often are able to understand new words, but find it difficult to use them in the correct situations. I decided to write this app to not only teach students the most important academic words, but also help them know how and when to use them. Consequently, the dictionary entries contain definitions AND example sentences written at a level of English that learners can understand.

Spelling, synonyms and grammar is all covered for each word to help students remember what they learn. 

If you are unable to pay the small fee for the full app, send me an email (see additional information) and I’ll send you a code to unlock the full app for free!

<h2><b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b></h2>

co.wordupapp.app,WordUp | AI Vocabulary Builder,"The world’s first AI-based English vocabulary builder app. If you are serious about your English, you will fall in love with WordUp. It is the smartest way to perfect your English, and learn every word that matters while enjoying the process!


Vocabulary Builder: 
Vocab builder feature in WordUp utilizes advanced algorithms to expand vocabulary and improve English skills. It recommends a new word each day based on your current knowledge, allowing you to gradually enhance your language proficiency. By incorporating daily words into your learning routine, WordUp ensures steady and consistent growth in your vocabulary.

Knowledge Map
WordUp helps you build a map of your knowledge by identifying the words you know and the words you don't know. It helps you learn new words by identifying the gaps in your vocabulary and suggesting the most important and useful English words to focus on. By incorporating daily vocabulary and tracking your progress, the Knowledge Map enables you to steadily increase your vocabulary and enhance your understanding of English words.
All 25,000 useful English words are ranked in the order of IMPORTANCE, and USEFULNESS, based on how often they are used in real-world spoken English (extracted from thousands of movies, and TV shows).

To actually learn the words that you discover in your Knowledge Map, WordUp gives you everything you need, and more! From word definitions and pictures to tens of entertaining examples from movies, quotes, news, and more. So you get a good feel of how to use each word in context. 

Multilingual Translations
There are also translations in more than 30 languages including French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, ...

The daily reviews then kick in. Like flashcards, the words will come back with games and challenges until you master them. It's called Spaced Repetition, and it's scientifically proven to help memorise them forever!

WordUp is unlike any vocabulary builder app you've seen before. It is not another dictionary app, although it can be used as an English dictionary too.

org.brilliant.android,Brilliant: Learn by doing,"Brilliant helps you excel in math and computer science with visual, interactive learning and personalized practice. Whether you’re a student or lifelong learner, Brilliant is designed to strengthen your STEM skills and turn you into a more confident thinker and problem solver.

Brilliant believes that everyone is a “math person”– it’s the way we learn math that can feel confusing. Here, you don’t memorize formulas. You explore concepts hands-on until they make sense. Brilliant guides you to real “aha” moments, helping you build the problem-solving skills, logic, and mathematical intuition needed for success in school, careers, and technical fields.

Our award-winning team of teachers and researchers from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Microsoft, Google, and more has built a world-class library of STEM courses. Learn everything from foundational math and algebra to college-level calculus, Python, programming, computer science, AI, neural networks, algorithms, data analysis, physics, and quantum computing. Join over 10 million learners using Brilliant’s interactive lessons to master math, computer science, and more.

WHY BRILLIANT WORKS

- Reach serious learning goals
Brilliant teaches through active problem solving – a method shown to be far more effective than passive learning like videos or lectures. Interactive problems, motivating challenges, and real-time feedback help you understand math, coding, and science concepts.
    
- Learning that adapts to you
Brilliant personalizes your experience, tailoring practice sets to your skill level and helping you progress at the right pace. Smart, adaptive learning tools reinforce core skills and prepare you for more advanced STEM topics.
    
- Build true problem-solving skills
Brilliant doesn’t give you answers – it gives just enough guidance to help you reason through problems yourself. So while you learn, you build the critical thinking and analytical skills needed for real-world problem solving.
    
- A massive library of expert-crafted content
With new and updated courses added every month, there’s always something to explore in algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, algorithms, Python, electrical engineering, data analysis, and more. Every course is crafted by human experts – not AI.

WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

“Brilliant has taught me mathematical concepts that I previously struggled to understand.” — Jacob S.

“Our kids are engaged in critical thinking and complex problem solving – but just feel like they’re having fun!” *—* Mark

“I am using this app while taking CS classes and it often does a better job at explaining concepts than my professors.” — Erald C.

• Get Talking Fast. With our interactive speaking challenges, kids will be encouraged to speak entire words and phrases on their own! The earlier kids start their language-learning journey, the more likely they are to reach proficiency quickly.

• Vocal Variety. Our characters' voices use different tones, expressions, and accents so that kids can pick up on the subtleties of pronunciation from different speakers.

• Designed by Experts. All our activities are designed by language and early-education experts. Thoughtfully developed lessons will build your child's confidence with every step.

• Learner Profiles (coming soon). Create up to four personalized profiles for different family members, allowing tailored learning paths and individual progress tracking.

You’ll have to manage behaviour and discipline rowdy students, stop the bullies, and be a mentor who inspires, all while you take control of the chaos of school life.

- Grade papers with care and precision, and watch your students’ results unfold.

Navigate school life in all its glory, there’s never a dull moment! Marking papers to disciplining students every day in the classroom is a new adventure.

com.db.lingotv,Japanese Speak: Aoi,"You're still struggling with your speaking even though you've studied Japanese for a long time?

You have high JLPT scores but you can't keep a conversation with a native speaker for more than 3 minutes?

It's a simple truth that most people just can't seem to get good at speaking Japanese.

The problem is we never get a chance to practice speaking because we've only focused on grammar and exams.

-

Aoi is an app that helps you get more comfortable speaking Japanese out loud by letting you practice speaking out loud more than any existing method.

Aoi process is simple:

1. Introduce you to Real Japanese that is essential to every day Japanese conversations
2. Practice real scripts written by Japanese people.
3. Simulate real situations where you’d actually use it

Whenever you’re using Aoi, you’ll be speaking a ton — and the app will always be listening and providing feedback to make sure you fix mistakes.

Just like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go in a pool instead of reading a swimming book, if you want to get good at Speaking Japanese, you’re gonna have to start actually speaking and do it every day! Aoi makes this realistic.

Aoi has 5 features that help learners improve Japanese speaking skills.

(1) Free Conversation: Aoi, equipped with ChatGPT and optimized for Japanese, can engage in role-playing conversations with learners in various scenarios, ensuring you excel in real-life Japanese communication.

(2) Pronunciation Correction: With the most advanced voice recognition AI, it can instantly judge and correct learners' pronunciation, making your Japanese accent closer to that of native speakers.

(3) Intelligent Prompts: When you are at a loss for words, Aoi can provide three options of what to say now, as well as create your own dialogue through translation features.

(4) Grammar Suggestions: Aoi will give grammar corrections and suggestion on your dialogue content, allowing you to effectively correct your oral mistakes.

(5) Rich Courses: Aoi covers 1000+ themed courses, including travel, life, work, interviews, and various scenarios, to meet a variety of learning application needs.

Written by TOEFL experts
------------------------
The entire TOEFL wordlist is selected and defined with usage examples by Magoosh’s expert TOEFL tutors, led by Chris Lele and Lucas Fink. Chris has been teaching the TOEFL for more than 10 years, runs a popular vocabulary series on YouTube and he’s also written an eBook on vocabulary. He is unbeatable in Scrabble, or any other word game for that matter. Lucas studied creative writing at Bard College and has been teaching English grammar and standardized tests since 2008.

Review that really sticks
-------------------------
Academic research has found that memories are formed by repeated exposure to new information, so Magoosh’s flashcard app uses a spaced repetition system. Words you are learning will reappear frequently (occurring less frequently the better you know them) and words you already know won’t be repeated. The TOEFL word list is also culled to only 600 so that you don't waste time learning unimportant words.

We're an online test prep company with a focus on teaching the TOEFL through videos and personalized customer support.

In addition to our online course, we blog about TOEFL strategies and test-taking tips at https://magoosh.com/toefl

Download the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.

<b>The secret path to language learning</b>
Remember the English language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of English grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.

<b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b>
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn English phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:

<b>Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right English pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

<b>State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your English words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak English clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

<b>Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning English. Mondly teaches you English vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.

<b>Learn conversational English.</b> Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core English vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak English clearly.

<b>Verb conjugations.</b> If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the English verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

<b>Advanced Statistics.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.

<b>The Leaderboard.</b> See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

<b>Adaptive Learning.</b> Learning English is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.

Before you know it, at the end of these English lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.",4561968,4.5820894,104717.0,"[{'name': 'Education', 'id': 'EDUCATION'}]",292.0,0,learn english free lesson daili let mondli teach english languag quickli effect just minut ll start memor core english word form sentenc learn speak english phrase take part convers fun english lesson improv vocabulari grammar pronunci like no other languag learn method beginn advanc learner travel busi profession tight schedul work great dynam adjust need explor languag exercis read listen write speak enhanc dictionari verb conjug state art speech recognit technolog ll feel like have own english languag tutor pocket download languag learn pill today enjoy benefit learn new languag life b secret path languag learn b rememb english languag class school start hundr basic word express continu ton english grammar lesson end full semest s languag cours could bare translat sentenc say hello foreign that s tradit way learn languag mondli ha differ approach that s opposit averag languag cours b thi how futur languag cours look like b get start basic convers between two peopl quickli start memor core word use them build sentenc phrase end minut modul are abl reconstruct that convers own voic s effect way learn english phrase state art natur speech recognit space repetit algorithm make effect learn languag here are key featur that make mondli great tutor b crystal clear audio profession voic actor b learn right english pronunci from convers between nativ speaker b state art speech recognit b mondli know exactli how listen english word phrase will onli get posit feedback if speak english clearli correctli thi will improv pronunci b use phrase real situat b memor hundr isol word not way go when come learn english mondli teach english vocabulari by offer core word phrase break learn process down into short lesson put them into theme pack b learn convers english b convers main reason take thi free cours will help build core english vocabulari wide use noun verb speak english clearli b verb conjug b if want learn more dure thi cours just tap english verb get full conjug screen includ translat s faster better than dictionari b advanc statist b use intellig report so can alway follow progress build vocabulari step by step becom better daili b leaderboard b see how friend are do compet peopl from all over world becom best learner mondli commun famili take weekli quiz becom even better b adapt learn b learn english differ from person person so we taught learn from way learn after littl time spent togeth mondli will understand what suit best will becom own guid custom teacher befor know end these english lesson will master most use word phrase will be fast lane learn new languag,437,221,0.505720823798627,4.963386727688787

english.practice.exercises,English Grammar and Vocabulary,"«English Grammar and Vocabulary» app has a new approach to English language learning. It offers users a lot of units which help them expand their grammar and vocabulary knowledge.

What do we mean by a unit? We choose an interesting topic to discuss and fill it with different activities. It can be a text, of course in English, with active words. Or it can be a list of words that will then appear in different tasks. We also find catching videos and fill them with useful information.

Another type of units is dedicated to a certain Grammar topic. We choose the most difficult and confusing grammar themes. At first we give a detailed explanation with lots of examples and then we offer users to improve new skills via exercises.

One of the most important ideas of our app is that each unit has a theory part and a part with practice. Such an approach lets users get the new material easier. And therefore — they learn English faster.

This application is an efficient way to learn English. It provides lots of tests and exercises in each unit. You can choose whether you want to learn grammar or new vocabulary today.

What’s important — you won’t find a big boring English course book inside. You will find a real transformer — make up your own book, learn certain topics which are interesting for you. And change English learning skills as you like: grammar, reading and vocabulary training.

At the same time this app will be a good assistant for you during your offline curriculum. But unlike large English course books, this app doesn’t require a lot of space in your bag. Everything you need for studying is in your pocket: learn something new and do exercises right after.

You will find very helpful features like active English word lists that include meanings, transcriptions, pictures and examples. All units have special marks that show a level. There are units for beginners, intermediates and advanced learners.

We have tried to choose the most popular topics that will be interesting to the majority of English learners. Space travels, universe problems, social media, job and many more.

We also choose the most necessary Grammar topics — those ones that confuse learners during their studies. But we don’t give long-read theoretical grammar articles. We divide big topics into smaller ones. Again, this helps students learn new grammar material faster.

That is why learning with «English Grammar and Vocabulary» app is an interesting, funny and efficient way to study English.

«English Grammar and Vocabulary» is a new rapidly developing app. Each week learners get new useful and engaging units with tests and exercises. Also, we embed tools and features that make the app’s functionality clear and easy to use.

Another important concept is that the app is absolutely free.

com.tvt.toeictest.newformat2019,New Practice for TOEIC® Test,"By applying the intelligent learning method - Spaced Repetition - you will see how ever easy to learn TOEIC® New Format 2020.

=> App includes more than 1.000 TOEIC® questions from  New Economy TOEIC®, Hacker New TOEIC®... NEW FORMAT 2020

=> Spaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. Spaced repetition is commonly applied in contexts in which a learner must acquire a large number of items and retain them indefinitely in memory. It is, therefore, well suited for the problem of vocabulary acquisition in the course of second language learning, due to the size of the target language's inventory of open-class words. (Wikipedia)

??? What's new in the TOEIC® New format?

---------- Listening Section ----------
- A reduced number of Photograph and Question Response questions
- An increased number of Conversation questions
- Conversations that include shorter turns and more exchanges
- More than two speakers in some conversations
- Conversations that include elisions (going to à gonna) and incomplete sentences/fragments (Yes, in a minute; Down the hall; Could you?)
- New question types testing the connection of what is heard in a conversation or talk and what is seen in a graphic
- New question types testing a speaker’s implied meaning in the context of a conversation or talk

---------- Reading Section ----------
- A reduced number of Incomplete Sentence questions
- Two new question-types testing understanding of the overall organization of passages:
- Text completion questions that ask test takers to choose which new sentence fits best in the context of the overall passage
- Set-based questions that ask test takers to understand where in the passage a sentence belongs
- Text messages, instant messages or online chat conversations with multiple writers
- Questions testing the understanding of three related texts
- A small increase in the number of single- and multiple-passage questions
- New questions about understating the writer’s words in context

If you ever feel frustrated because you do not understand fast-speaking natives, you forget new expressions, you freeze up in conversation (not knowing the right word), or you do not feel confident and natural speaking, then download RealLife English now! Just look how it helped this learner:

""…my English isn't perfect… but the app has really helped me to build up my vocabulary. Sometimes I'm having conversations with my colleagues who are natives. When I listen to a word that I learned using the app, I just feel really, really happy because I'm making improvements. It also helped me to improve my pronunciation…. specifically, about the connected speech and how I should pronounce it. I'm trying to focus my efforts on that. I feel like I'm going to achieve my goals if I continue using the app.” (Daniel G. 🇲🇽)

Most classes and apps promise you fluency in months, but then do not prepare you for real-life, everyday situations. You’re left stuck, your English does not flow. 

Our global team of language learning experts is committed to creating tools for English learners like you that actually work so you can:
–Always remember the right word at the right time
–Understand practically 100% of what natives say
–Speak English effortlessly and clearly in any situation without fear or mistakes
–Unlock new opportunities in your life.

➡️ How it works:

1. 👂🏼LEARN—We have a huge variety of FUN real-life conversation videos where you’ll learn English you’ll actually use in your everyday life, while developing your listening to understand fast-native speech and vocabulary
2. 🧠 PRACTICE—Watching each lesson, you will unlock Vocabulary Flashcards with the new advanced expressions that you need for your life. These use innovative technology that helps you never forget the new expressions
3. 🗣️ SPEAK—Actually use your English and discover other cultures in conversations with real people from around the world in the Global Speak. It’s okay if you are shy. The first two steps will help you build your confidence and develop the skills to communicate naturally in any situation without fear or mistakes. Take your time.

👉🏼 When you first download the app, to get the best experience we highly recommend you join the free RealLife Way Mini-Course, which will introduce you to our popular method and help you be successful!

Look at what other members of our Global Community say:

Mondly’s state-of-the-art speech recognition shows you how well you already speak and where you can improve. It’s fun and doesn’t even feel like learning. Especially because Mondly by Pearson uses your mother language so you never get lost in translation.

<b>The second step is even easier</b>. Take a break. Your lesson is never more than 9 minutes long and here is why: Your brain needs a rest to store the new information. And while you’re busy with your life, Japanese words and sentences get anchored in your long-term memory.

<b>The result:</b> You find yourself effortlessly knowing what to say and when. Don’t worry about the exact timing. Mondly by Pearson gives you control over the entire process. You receive friendly reminders exactly when your brain is set for the next dose of knowledge.

<b>The third step is all about you.</b> Because now you’re ready to create your own phrases and adding your individual touch and personality back into the conversation. And when you want to practice, Mondly’s interactive chat-bot becomes your pocket tutor. 

There are over 40 practical, real-life situations which take you to the restaurant, shopping, exploring the city and many more.
But that’s not the only reason why Mondly by Pearson gives you the confidence to speak Japanese. Because the HandsFree mode lets you practice without looking at the screen. Just connect your headphones and you’re in Paris, chatting away with the locals.

<b>Need a quick boost of motivation?</b> Check your progress with the advanced statistics and intelligent reporting. It shows you how far you have come in your journey to master the 5,000 words and phrases Mondly by Pearson offers you.

<b>We all learn in different ways so here are some of the other highlights Mondly by Pearson offers:</b>
• Well-structured grammar drills which integrate seamlessly into the content of the lessons
• Verb conjugations to show you the underlining structure and further boost your confidence
• Reading and writing games to complete your skills and give you full independence

So what does the ILA-Method stand for? It’s Immersive Language Acquisition and it means with Mondly by Pearson you pick up Japanese in the most natural way possible. But don’t trust the over 100 million users who have given the app a 4.7/5.0 rating. 

<b>Here’s what the press had to say:</b>

» “The new and sexier way to learn languages” - Huffington Post
»  “Closest thing to actual immersion” - TNW
» “A practical approach to language learning likely to be widely adopted.” - Forbes
» “The new way to learn languages” - Inc.com

Hello-Hello Japanese  is a full-fledged language course with 30 LESSONS developed in collaboration with the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), so you can be assured that these lessons follow an effective research-based methodology. All lessons are conversational based on realistic dialogues and situations, rather than a collection of out-of-context words and phrases.

All the content is stored in the app so that you have great responsiveness when you are ready to learn a language. You do not need to be connected to Wi-Fi or 3G networks to run the app. With Hello-Hello Janapiese you will be able to do the lessons and practice vocabulary anytime, anywhere developing all the skills you need to communicate in a foreign language. All lessons were recorded by native speakers so you can learn the correct pronunciation.

With Hello-Hello Japanese you can also:

Practice vocabulary with more than 300 words and phrases using our FLASHCARDS feature!  (Please note that we will be adding more words and phrases in upcoming updates.)

Save your own NOTES form any lesson.

Full localization: You can see the entire app, including the translations of the lessons and words lists in your native language! Languages available: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese and Portuguese.
 
Note about our methodology: At first, our lessons might seem advanced for some people but there is a purpose behind it. Our lessons are structured to give learners the ability to communicate effectively with others.  If the learner is new to the language, it will be necessary to spend more time learning the basic phrases in order to begin to gain proficiency in the language.  For those who already know other related languages, the time factor may not be as great to learn the basics. Beginners need to go slowly and may need to do the activities several times before they gain a comfort level in using them. And remember: The more time you spend doing the exercises, the more proficient you will become!

CONTACT US:  We are constantly trying to improve the app and take feedback from our users very seriously. The app has a “Contact Us” icon so that you can contact us easily, so please do not hesitate and send us an email if you have any questions, comments, complaints or suggestions.
