com.nemoapps.android.japanese,Nemo Japanese,"Nemo is designed to start you speaking the most useful words in Japanese immediately and confidently. With millions of downloads from around the world, Nemo is now available for Android phones and tablets.

✓ Every Japanese word is pronounced clearly in high quality audio from a native speaker.
✓ All audio is downloaded to your device, and is available offline or in airplane mode.
✓ Master your accent with the Speech Studio. Simply record yourself saying a phrase and then hear your voice next to the teacher’s. Then try again. You’ll be AMAZED how quickly your foreign accent melts away.
✓ Nemo is not built around lessons at all. It is meant to be picked up throughout the day, whenever you have a few minutes to spare.
✓ NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE of Japanese is required.

Nemo targets the words and phrases most often used in conversation. For beginners, we’ve prepared “If You Only Learn 10 Things”, “If You Only Learn 50 Things”, and “If You Only Learn 100 Things” lists for a fast introduction to the essentials. Intermediate learners can progress to a course of the highest frequency words needed for travel and business and begin to have conversations in Japanese in a month. Advanced students will benefit most from the Speech Studio technology to correct their foreign accent.

With Nemo, you can customize flashcards to exercise the language skill you want to improve. When beginning a new topic, setup flashcards to practice translation of Japanese to English so you can build familiarity with new words. Next, switch to translate English to Japanese to train your recall and ability to speak. To complete mastery, switch to cards that specialize in fine-tuning your listening and perfecting your pronunciation.

Any card can be marked as a favorite, allowing you to make your own custom deck of cards to focus on the words of the day. Turn on Review Mode to recap what you practiced earlier in the day to boost your memory retention.

Dive into what you want to learn at any time. The phrasebook offers quick access to the vocabulary in the app through a Japanese-English dictionary interface. Nemo also functions as a translator. Simply find the words you need in the search interface and play its audio through the device speaker.

◆ Get off the beaten path or find comfort with traveler phrases.
◆ Build your proficiency with numbers and the most important verbs and sentence building blocks.

Japanese is the primary language spoken in Japan and cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Fukuoka. It is normally written in Kanji and Kana characters. In this app, you can display Japanese words in either Japanese characters, Roman script, or both.

Use your new skills to make friends, impress old friends, bring smiles to children, get out of jams, experience new things, talk confidently, and make your travel and cultural experience more rich and fulfilling.

Practice vocabulary with more than 300 words and phrases using our FLASHCARDS feature!  (Please note that we will be adding more words and phrases in upcoming updates.)

Save your own NOTES form any lesson.

Full localization: You can see the entire app, including the translations of the lessons and words lists in your native language! Languages available: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese and Portuguese.
 
Note about our methodology: At first, our lessons might seem advanced for some people but there is a purpose behind it. Our lessons are structured to give learners the ability to communicate effectively with others.  If the learner is new to the language, it will be necessary to spend more time learning the basic phrases in order to begin to gain proficiency in the language.  For those who already know other related languages, the time factor may not be as great to learn the basics. Beginners need to go slowly and may need to do the activities several times before they gain a comfort level in using them. And remember: The more time you spend doing the exercises, the more proficient you will become!

CONTACT US:  We are constantly trying to improve the app and take feedback from our users very seriously. The app has a “Contact Us” icon so that you can contact us easily, so please do not hesitate and send us an email if you have any questions, comments, complaints or suggestions.

About the developer

My name is Sam and I am an Academic English teacher. I have found that my students often are able to understand new words, but find it difficult to use them in the correct situations. I decided to write this app to not only teach students the most important academic words, but also help them know how and when to use them. Consequently, the dictionary entries contain definitions AND example sentences written at a level of English that learners can understand.

Spelling, synonyms and grammar is all covered for each word to help students remember what they learn. 

If you are unable to pay the small fee for the full app, send me an email (see additional information) and I’ll send you a code to unlock the full app for free!

Hello-Hello Japanese  is a full-fledged language course with 30 LESSONS developed in collaboration with the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), so you can be assured that these lessons follow an effective research-based methodology. All lessons are conversational based on realistic dialogues and situations, rather than a collection of out-of-context words and phrases.

All the content is stored in the app so that you have great responsiveness when you are ready to learn a language. You do not need to be connected to Wi-Fi or 3G networks to run the app. With Hello-Hello Janapiese you will be able to do the lessons and practice vocabulary anytime, anywhere developing all the skills you need to communicate in a foreign language. All lessons were recorded by native speakers so you can learn the correct pronunciation.

Full localization: You can see the entire app, including the translations of the lessons and words lists in your native language! Languages available: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese and Portuguese.
 
Note about our methodology: At first, our lessons might seem advanced for some people but there is a purpose behind it. Our lessons are structured to give learners the ability to communicate effectively with others.  If the learner is new to the language, it will be necessary to spend more time learning the basic phrases in order to begin to gain proficiency in the language.  For those who already know other related languages, the time factor may not be as great to learn the basics. Beginners need to go slowly and may need to do the activities several times before they gain a comfort level in using them. And remember: The more time you spend doing the exercises, the more proficient you will become!

CONTACT US:  We are constantly trying to improve the app and take feedback from our users very seriously. The app has a “Contact Us” icon so that you can contact us easily, so please do not hesitate and send us an email if you have any questions, comments, complaints or suggestions.

<b>The secret path to language learning</b>
Remember the English language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of English grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.

<b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b>
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn English phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:

<b>Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right English pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

<b>State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your English words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak English clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

<b>Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning English. Mondly teaches you English vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.

<b>Learn conversational English.</b> Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core English vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak English clearly.

<b>Verb conjugations.</b> If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the English verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

<b>Advanced Statistics.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.

<b>The Leaderboard.</b> See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

<b>Adaptive Learning.</b> Learning English is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.

Before you know it, at the end of these English lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.",4558630,4.593985,104705.0,"[{'name': 'Education', 'id': 'EDUCATION'}]",284.0,0

com.atistudios.italk.ja,Learn Japanese. Speak Japanese,"<b>Speak Japanese faster</b> than you ever imagined with Mondly’s proprietary ILA-method. How? The secret is to make it simple. Have you ever heard a song in the radio which had you bopping your head and wanting to sing along? 

<b>The first step of learning Japanese</b> is pretty similar. You listen to the sound of native Japanese speakers and repeat some of their words.

Mondly’s state-of-the-art speech recognition shows you how well you already speak and where you can improve. It’s fun and doesn’t even feel like learning. Especially because Mondly by Pearson uses your mother language so you never get lost in translation.

<b>The second step is even easier</b>. Take a break. Your lesson is never more than 9 minutes long and here is why: Your brain needs a rest to store the new information. And while you’re busy with your life, Japanese words and sentences get anchored in your long-term memory.

<b>The result:</b> You find yourself effortlessly knowing what to say and when. Don’t worry about the exact timing. Mondly by Pearson gives you control over the entire process. You receive friendly reminders exactly when your brain is set for the next dose of knowledge.

<b>The third step is all about you.</b> Because now you’re ready to create your own phrases and adding your individual touch and personality back into the conversation. And when you want to practice, Mondly’s interactive chat-bot becomes your pocket tutor. 

There are over 40 practical, real-life situations which take you to the restaurant, shopping, exploring the city and many more.
But that’s not the only reason why Mondly by Pearson gives you the confidence to speak Japanese. Because the HandsFree mode lets you practice without looking at the screen. Just connect your headphones and you’re in Paris, chatting away with the locals.

<b>Need a quick boost of motivation?</b> Check your progress with the advanced statistics and intelligent reporting. It shows you how far you have come in your journey to master the 5,000 words and phrases Mondly by Pearson offers you.

<b>We all learn in different ways so here are some of the other highlights Mondly by Pearson offers:</b>
• Well-structured grammar drills which integrate seamlessly into the content of the lessons
• Verb conjugations to show you the underlining structure and further boost your confidence
• Reading and writing games to complete your skills and give you full independence

So what does the ILA-Method stand for? It’s Immersive Language Acquisition and it means with Mondly by Pearson you pick up Japanese in the most natural way possible. But don’t trust the over 100 million users who have given the app a 4.7/5.0 rating. 

<b>Here’s what the press had to say:</b>

» “The new and sexier way to learn languages” - Huffington Post
»  “Closest thing to actual immersion” - TNW
» “A practical approach to language learning likely to be widely adopted.” - Forbes
» “The new way to learn languages” - Inc.com

He has been teaching the GRE for more than 10 years, runs a popular vocabulary series on YouTube and he’s also written an eBook on vocabulary. He is nigh unbeatable in Scrabble, or any other word game for that matter.


How well will I learn the words?

===

Academic research has found that memories are formed by repeated exposure to new information, so Magoosh’s flashcard app uses a spaced repetition system. Words you are learning will reappear frequently (occurring less frequently the better you know them) and words you already know won’t be repeated. The GRE word list is culled so that you focus on only the most important words.


Your practice will focus on the words that you need to review the most to make sure the words you learn will really stick.


What is Magoosh?

===

english.practice.exercises,English Grammar and Vocabulary,"«English Grammar and Vocabulary» app has a new approach to English language learning. It offers users a lot of units which help them expand their grammar and vocabulary knowledge.

What do we mean by a unit? We choose an interesting topic to discuss and fill it with different activities. It can be a text, of course in English, with active words. Or it can be a list of words that will then appear in different tasks. We also find catching videos and fill them with useful information.

Another type of units is dedicated to a certain Grammar topic. We choose the most difficult and confusing grammar themes. At first we give a detailed explanation with lots of examples and then we offer users to improve new skills via exercises.

One of the most important ideas of our app is that each unit has a theory part and a part with practice. Such an approach lets users get the new material easier. And therefore — they learn English faster.

This application is an efficient way to learn English. It provides lots of tests and exercises in each unit. You can choose whether you want to learn grammar or new vocabulary today.

What’s important — you won’t find a big boring English course book inside. You will find a real transformer — make up your own book, learn certain topics which are interesting for you. And change English learning skills as you like: grammar, reading and vocabulary training.

At the same time this app will be a good assistant for you during your offline curriculum. But unlike large English course books, this app doesn’t require a lot of space in your bag. Everything you need for studying is in your pocket: learn something new and do exercises right after.

You will find very helpful features like active English word lists that include meanings, transcriptions, pictures and examples. All units have special marks that show a level. There are units for beginners, intermediates and advanced learners.

We have tried to choose the most popular topics that will be interesting to the majority of English learners. Space travels, universe problems, social media, job and many more.

We also choose the most necessary Grammar topics — those ones that confuse learners during their studies. But we don’t give long-read theoretical grammar articles. We divide big topics into smaller ones. Again, this helps students learn new grammar material faster.

That is why learning with «English Grammar and Vocabulary» app is an interesting, funny and efficient way to study English.

«English Grammar and Vocabulary» is a new rapidly developing app. Each week learners get new useful and engaging units with tests and exercises. Also, we embed tools and features that make the app’s functionality clear and easy to use.

Another important concept is that the app is absolutely free. No hidden payments inside.",571029,4.67,6605.0,"[{'name': 'Education', 'id': 'EDUCATION'}]",83.0,1

I made Jinjja with the belief that language has its own way of being learned.
Hangul is easy, but Korean is hard, right?
This app is for those who want to move beyond beginner level.
If you can read Hangul now and find other apps too easy, join us at Jinjja!


Why Jinjja?

1. Not AI-generated expressions 
Learn from 2,000+ expressions that Koreans actually use. Every expression was created by a Korean (me).

2. Learn through context
Not just memorization—naturally pick up when and with what nuance to use expressions in real conversations.

3. Science-backed review system
Smart reviews based on the forgetting curve turn what you learn into long-term memory.


3 Learning Modes
Language is vocabulary, speaking, and listening!

1. Real Talk
Learn the context of real Korean conversations.
From formal speech to casual talk and jokes between friends—master expressions for every situation.

2. Vocab
Swipe once to sort words you know from words you don't.
Combined Anki + skimming technique lets you acquire vocabulary in no time.

3. Listening
Listen and learn real expressions with native pronunciation.
Just listen, it'll click.


I'm building Jinjja with love and passion. More features are coming in 2026.
I recommend Jinjja if you:

- Are intermediate in Korean but still feel awkward talking with Koreans
- Understand dramas but go blank when you try to speak
- Finished Korean basics but struggle with natural expressions
- Want to understand K-dramas or K-pop lyrics without subtitles
- Want to chat more naturally with Korean friends or colleagues
- Want to speak like a local when traveling in Korea
- Want to learn real, living Korean—not textbook Korean

Break free from textbook Korean. The language actually used in Korea. The expressions Koreans really use.

com.aomiapp.aomi,Aomi Japanese: Speaking,"Aomi Japanese is the very 1st app that trains your Japanese speaking skills and pronunciation by using pitch-accent recognition & visualization technology.

Practicing with Aomi Japanese will:

• Develop your articulation
• Help you to learn proper pronunciation
• Activate your listening comprehension
• Enrich your vocabulary with a variety of useful expressions used by native speakers in everyday life

The unique feature of Aomi is its visualized pronunciation. You are not only comparing yourself with the native speaker just by listening to pronunciation, but also by actually seeing how well you match it.

Why is it important?

The Japanese language is a musical language. Unlike English, it doesn’t have a stress-accent but it has a “musical accent” known as pitch-accent. 

Pitch-accent is a decrease or increase in the tone of voice between syllables in a single word. Our technology analyzes pitch patterns of your voice and compares them to the proper pitch patterns of a native speaker. Then it presents your pronunciation visually in the form of a ""wave"". The wave indicates the highs and lows of the pitch. 

It helps you to compare your pronunciation not only by audio but also visually by comparing your “wave” with the “wave” of the native speaker.

By following visualized pronunciation you will see the actual patterns of the Japanese speech and learn proper pronunciation much faster than you would do just by listening. 

Everyday, Aomi provides you with a training, which consists of expressions that native speakers use in their daily life + the examples of how those expressions can be used. 

As you continue practicing day after day, you will naturally develop a proper articulation, which will make you sound like a native speaker. And your speech will be enriched with useful vocabulary that can’t be found in an ordinary textbook. 

All the materials from Trainings will be accessible to you in the app's “Glossary”. You can practice pronunciation of any word or phrase as much as you want at any time, anywhere. 

In addition to Training and Glossary you can freely explore and practice slang, loan words, tongue twisters and many other words and phrases that will boost your speaking skills even further.

Practicing with Aomi everyday you will create your personal language environment free of any embarrassment, available to you at any time, anywhere. 

=======================


PLEASE NOTE:

To access all Trainings and features of Aomi Japanese app you will need to have a subscription. You can always try the app for free with a limited access. 

• Payment will be charged to Google Play at confirmation of purchase.
• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal
• Subscription may be managed by the user by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.

<b>One minute lessons</b> Taking into account busyness of modern life, we designed each lesson in the way so it would never take more than one minute to complete it! So you no longer need to search for free time to practice French! Simply, once you get a chance, launch the app and do one lesson at a time =)

<b>Only useful French words</b> French for Beginners: LinDuo HD is a free and quick start to learn French language! Unlike others, we have only the most useful words, which are divided into 180 topic based lessons. Quality is here!

Teach-yourself French is designed, that it will use your visual and echoic memory to help you memorize French words fast and easy!

<b>Special illustrations</b> We use only specially developed infographics (developed by psychologists), so your eyes can quickly identify meaning of word or action without stressing them with small unnecessary details.

<b>Word pronunciation by native speakers</b> Our app will help you master pronunciation of French words! Each word is recording by professional native speaker! Additionally, in the settings you can choose between male or female voice.

<b>Dynamic lesson difficulty</b> The app changes lesson difficulty gradually as you progress. To achieve this, it keeps stats for EVERY word! Example: in the spelling mode, initially you need to insert several missing letters in a word, then create a word having extra letters and finally, when you are ready, you will need to type the entire word on the keyboard.

<b>Modes for quick learning</b> The App includes four additional lesson types which are made of Favorites, Difficult, Old, Random words. You can add any word to your favorites and later create custom lesson from your Favorite words. Words are automatically added to ""Difficult"" (the ones you struggle to memorize) and ""Old"" (which you have not reviewed for a long time) sections. A ""Random"" mode will create a unique lesson.

<b>Do not need to know how to read</b> If you cannot read yet, no problem! Each word has a transcription in your language! And for more experienced ones, in the settings, you can choose a phonetic (like in a dictionary) transcription.

<b>Additional features</b> Thanks to your reviews, we are constantly updating the app to make it better! To help you take care of your eyesight, with just one tap, you can activate dark theme. If you temporarily do not have internet access, no problem! The App can work offline as well!

<b>Review Past Material</b> Many good apps do not pay enough attention to review past material! For this purpose we created the word game ""True or False"". It is very simple, but it's addictive and the most importantly, it helps to repeat past material and never to forget it!

If you have any questions or suggestions, please never hesitate to send us an email <b>admin@lin-duo.com</b>!

WHY BRILLIANT WORKS

- A massive library of expert-crafted content
With new and updated courses added every month, there’s always something to explore in algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, algorithms, Python, electrical engineering, data analysis, and more. Every course is crafted by human experts – not AI.
