com.atistudios.italk.ja,Learn Japanese. Speak Japanese,"<b>Speak Japanese faster</b> than you ever imagined with Mondly’s proprietary ILA-method. How? The secret is to make it simple. Have you ever heard a song in the radio which had you bopping your head and wanting to sing along? 

<b>The first step of learning Japanese</b> is pretty similar. You listen to the sound of native Japanese speakers and repeat some of their words.

Mondly’s state-of-the-art speech recognition shows you how well you already speak and where you can improve. It’s fun and doesn’t even feel like learning. Especially because Mondly by Pearson uses your mother language so you never get lost in translation.

<b>The second step is even easier</b>. Take a break. Your lesson is never more than 9 minutes long and here is why: Your brain needs a rest to store the new information. And while you’re busy with your life, Japanese words and sentences get anchored in your long-term memory.

<b>The result:</b> You find yourself effortlessly knowing what to say and when. Don’t worry about the exact timing. Mondly by Pearson gives you control over the entire process. You receive friendly reminders exactly when your brain is set for the next dose of knowledge.

<b>The third step is all about you.</b> Because now you’re ready to create your own phrases and adding your individual touch and personality back into the conversation. And when you want to practice, Mondly’s interactive chat-bot becomes your pocket tutor. 

There are over 40 practical, real-life situations which take you to the restaurant, shopping, exploring the city and many more.
But that’s not the only reason why Mondly by Pearson gives you the confidence to speak Japanese. Because the HandsFree mode lets you practice without looking at the screen. Just connect your headphones and you’re in Paris, chatting away with the locals.

<b>Need a quick boost of motivation?</b> Check your progress with the advanced statistics and intelligent reporting. It shows you how far you have come in your journey to master the 5,000 words and phrases Mondly by Pearson offers you.

<b>We all learn in different ways so here are some of the other highlights Mondly by Pearson offers:</b>
• Well-structured grammar drills which integrate seamlessly into the content of the lessons
• Verb conjugations to show you the underlining structure and further boost your confidence
• Reading and writing games to complete your skills and give you full independence

So what does the ILA-Method stand for? It’s Immersive Language Acquisition and it means with Mondly by Pearson you pick up Japanese in the most natural way possible. But don’t trust the over 100 million users who have given the app a 4.7/5.0 rating. 

<b>Here’s what the press had to say:</b>

» “The new and sexier way to learn languages” - Huffington Post
»  “Closest thing to actual immersion” - TNW
» “A practical approach to language learning likely to be widely adopted.” - Forbes
» “The new way to learn languages” - Inc.com

About the developer

My name is Sam and I am an Academic English teacher. I have found that my students often are able to understand new words, but find it difficult to use them in the correct situations. I decided to write this app to not only teach students the most important academic words, but also help them know how and when to use them. Consequently, the dictionary entries contain definitions AND example sentences written at a level of English that learners can understand.

Spelling, synonyms and grammar is all covered for each word to help students remember what they learn. 

If you are unable to pay the small fee for the full app, send me an email (see additional information) and I’ll send you a code to unlock the full app for free!

com.hanum.jinjja,"Jinjja, your Korean booster.","Hi, I'm Hanum, the maker of Jinjja.
I made Jinjja with the belief that language has its own way of being learned.
Hangul is easy, but Korean is hard, right?
This app is for those who want to move beyond beginner level.
If you can read Hangul now and find other apps too easy, join us at Jinjja!


Why Jinjja?

1. Not AI-generated expressions 
Learn from 2,000+ expressions that Koreans actually use. Every expression was created by a Korean (me).

2. Learn through context
Not just memorization—naturally pick up when and with what nuance to use expressions in real conversations.

3. Science-backed review system
Smart reviews based on the forgetting curve turn what you learn into long-term memory.


3 Learning Modes
Language is vocabulary, speaking, and listening!

1. Real Talk
Learn the context of real Korean conversations.
From formal speech to casual talk and jokes between friends—master expressions for every situation.

2. Vocab
Swipe once to sort words you know from words you don't.
Combined Anki + skimming technique lets you acquire vocabulary in no time.

3. Listening
Listen and learn real expressions with native pronunciation.
Just listen, it'll click.


I'm building Jinjja with love and passion. More features are coming in 2026.
I recommend Jinjja if you:

- Are intermediate in Korean but still feel awkward talking with Koreans
- Understand dramas but go blank when you try to speak
- Finished Korean basics but struggle with natural expressions
- Want to understand K-dramas or K-pop lyrics without subtitles
- Want to chat more naturally with Korean friends or colleagues
- Want to speak like a local when traveling in Korea
- Want to learn real, living Korean—not textbook Korean

Break free from textbook Korean. The language actually used in Korea. The expressions Koreans really use.

-- New games to practice reading and listening skills 
-- Cleaner and more friendly user interface 
-- Follow your course progress 
-- Take notes 
-- Receive notifications with lesson reminders. The more you practice, the more you learn! 
-- Receive notifications with new words to build your vocabulary 

Hello-Hello Japanese  is a full-fledged language course with 30 LESSONS developed in collaboration with the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), so you can be assured that these lessons follow an effective research-based methodology. All lessons are conversational based on realistic dialogues and situations, rather than a collection of out-of-context words and phrases.

All the content is stored in the app so that you have great responsiveness when you are ready to learn a language. You do not need to be connected to Wi-Fi or 3G networks to run the app. With Hello-Hello Janapiese you will be able to do the lessons and practice vocabulary anytime, anywhere developing all the skills you need to communicate in a foreign language. All lessons were recorded by native speakers so you can learn the correct pronunciation.

With Hello-Hello Japanese you can also:

Practice vocabulary with more than 300 words and phrases using our FLASHCARDS feature!  (Please note that we will be adding more words and phrases in upcoming updates.)

Save your own NOTES form any lesson.

Full localization: You can see the entire app, including the translations of the lessons and words lists in your native language! Languages available: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese and Portuguese.
 
Note about our methodology: At first, our lessons might seem advanced for some people but there is a purpose behind it. Our lessons are structured to give learners the ability to communicate effectively with others.  If the learner is new to the language, it will be necessary to spend more time learning the basic phrases in order to begin to gain proficiency in the language.  For those who already know other related languages, the time factor may not be as great to learn the basics. Beginners need to go slowly and may need to do the activities several times before they gain a comfort level in using them. And remember: The more time you spend doing the exercises, the more proficient you will become!

CONTACT US:  We are constantly trying to improve the app and take feedback from our users very seriously. The app has a “Contact Us” icon so that you can contact us easily, so please do not hesitate and send us an email if you have any questions, comments, complaints or suggestions.

Written by TOEFL experts
------------------------
The entire TOEFL wordlist is selected and defined with usage examples by Magoosh’s expert TOEFL tutors, led by Chris Lele and Lucas Fink. Chris has been teaching the TOEFL for more than 10 years, runs a popular vocabulary series on YouTube and he’s also written an eBook on vocabulary. He is unbeatable in Scrabble, or any other word game for that matter. Lucas studied creative writing at Bard College and has been teaching English grammar and standardized tests since 2008.

Review that really sticks
-------------------------
Academic research has found that memories are formed by repeated exposure to new information, so Magoosh’s flashcard app uses a spaced repetition system. Words you are learning will reappear frequently (occurring less frequently the better you know them) and words you already know won’t be repeated. The TOEFL word list is also culled to only 600 so that you don't waste time learning unimportant words.

*You learn fast*
 
In 3 months, you will cover a language program designed for a one-year college course.

english.practice.exercises,English Grammar and Vocabulary,"«English Grammar and Vocabulary» app has a new approach to English language learning. It offers users a lot of units which help them expand their grammar and vocabulary knowledge.

What do we mean by a unit? We choose an interesting topic to discuss and fill it with different activities. It can be a text, of course in English, with active words. Or it can be a list of words that will then appear in different tasks. We also find catching videos and fill them with useful information.

Another type of units is dedicated to a certain Grammar topic. We choose the most difficult and confusing grammar themes. At first we give a detailed explanation with lots of examples and then we offer users to improve new skills via exercises.

One of the most important ideas of our app is that each unit has a theory part and a part with practice. Such an approach lets users get the new material easier. And therefore — they learn English faster.

This application is an efficient way to learn English. It provides lots of tests and exercises in each unit. You can choose whether you want to learn grammar or new vocabulary today.

What’s important — you won’t find a big boring English course book inside. You will find a real transformer — make up your own book, learn certain topics which are interesting for you. And change English learning skills as you like: grammar, reading and vocabulary training.

At the same time this app will be a good assistant for you during your offline curriculum. But unlike large English course books, this app doesn’t require a lot of space in your bag. Everything you need for studying is in your pocket: learn something new and do exercises right after.

You will find very helpful features like active English word lists that include meanings, transcriptions, pictures and examples. All units have special marks that show a level. There are units for beginners, intermediates and advanced learners.

We have tried to choose the most popular topics that will be interesting to the majority of English learners. Space travels, universe problems, social media, job and many more.

We also choose the most necessary Grammar topics — those ones that confuse learners during their studies. But we don’t give long-read theoretical grammar articles. We divide big topics into smaller ones. Again, this helps students learn new grammar material faster.

That is why learning with «English Grammar and Vocabulary» app is an interesting, funny and efficient way to study English.

«English Grammar and Vocabulary» is a new rapidly developing app. Each week learners get new useful and engaging units with tests and exercises. Also, we embed tools and features that make the app’s functionality clear and easy to use.

Another important concept is that the app is absolutely free. No hidden payments inside.",571334,4.67,6610.0,"[{'name': 'Education', 'id': 'EDUCATION'}]",84.0,1,english grammar vocabulari ha new approach english languag learn offer user lot unit which help them expand their grammar vocabulari knowledg what do we mean by unit we choos interest topic discuss fill differ activ can be text cours english activ word can be list word that will then appear differ task we also find catch video fill them use inform anoth type unit dedic certain grammar topic we choos most difficult confus grammar theme first we give detail explan lot exampl then we offer user improv new skill via exercis one most import idea our that each unit ha theori part part practic such approach let user get new materi easier therefor they learn english faster thi applic effici way learn english provid lot test exercis each unit can choos whether want learn grammar new vocabulari today what s import won t find big bore english cours book insid will find real transform make up own book learn certain topic which are interest chang english learn skill as like grammar read vocabulari train same time thi will be good assist dure offlin curriculum but unlik larg english cours book thi doesn t requir lot space bag everyth need studi pocket learn someth new do exercis right after will find veri help featur like activ english word list that includ mean transcript pictur exampl all unit have special mark that show level there are unit beginn intermedi advanc learner we have tri choos most popular topic that will be interest major english learner space travel univers problem social media job mani more we also choos most necessari grammar topic those one that confus learner dure their studi but we don t give long read theoret grammar articl we divid big topic into smaller one again thi help student learn new grammar materi faster that whi learn english grammar vocabulari interest funni effici way studi english english grammar vocabulari new rapidli develop each week learner get new use engag unit test exercis also we emb tool featur that make s function clear easi use anoth import concept that absolut free no hidden payment insid

org.brilliant.android,Brilliant: Learn by doing,"Brilliant helps you excel in math and computer science with visual, interactive learning and personalized practice. Whether you’re a student or lifelong learner, Brilliant is designed to strengthen your STEM skills and turn you into a more confident thinker and problem solver.

Brilliant believes that everyone is a “math person”– it’s the way we learn math that can feel confusing. Here, you don’t memorize formulas. You explore concepts hands-on until they make sense. Brilliant guides you to real “aha” moments, helping you build the problem-solving skills, logic, and mathematical intuition needed for success in school, careers, and technical fields.

Our award-winning team of teachers and researchers from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Microsoft, Google, and more has built a world-class library of STEM courses. Learn everything from foundational math and algebra to college-level calculus, Python, programming, computer science, AI, neural networks, algorithms, data analysis, physics, and quantum computing. Join over 10 million learners using Brilliant’s interactive lessons to master math, computer science, and more.

WHY BRILLIANT WORKS

- Reach serious learning goals
Brilliant teaches through active problem solving – a method shown to be far more effective than passive learning like videos or lectures. Interactive problems, motivating challenges, and real-time feedback help you understand math, coding, and science concepts.
    
- Learning that adapts to you
Brilliant personalizes your experience, tailoring practice sets to your skill level and helping you progress at the right pace. Smart, adaptive learning tools reinforce core skills and prepare you for more advanced STEM topics.
    
- Build true problem-solving skills
Brilliant doesn’t give you answers – it gives just enough guidance to help you reason through problems yourself. So while you learn, you build the critical thinking and analytical skills needed for real-world problem solving.
    
- A massive library of expert-crafted content
With new and updated courses added every month, there’s always something to explore in algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, algorithms, Python, electrical engineering, data analysis, and more. Every course is crafted by human experts – not AI.

WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

“Brilliant has taught me mathematical concepts that I previously struggled to understand.” — Jacob S.

“Our kids are engaged in critical thinking and complex problem solving – but just feel like they’re having fun!” *—* Mark

“I am using this app while taking CS classes and it often does a better job at explaining concepts than my professors.” — Erald C.

• Vocal Variety. Our characters' voices use different tones, expressions, and accents so that kids can pick up on the subtleties of pronunciation from different speakers.

• Designed by Experts. All our activities are designed by language and early-education experts. Thoughtfully developed lessons will build your child's confidence with every step.

com.aomiapp.aomi,Aomi Japanese: Speaking,"Aomi Japanese is the very 1st app that trains your Japanese speaking skills and pronunciation by using pitch-accent recognition & visualization technology.

Practicing with Aomi Japanese will:

• Develop your articulation
• Help you to learn proper pronunciation
• Activate your listening comprehension
• Enrich your vocabulary with a variety of useful expressions used by native speakers in everyday life

The unique feature of Aomi is its visualized pronunciation. You are not only comparing yourself with the native speaker just by listening to pronunciation, but also by actually seeing how well you match it.

Why is it important?

The Japanese language is a musical language. Unlike English, it doesn’t have a stress-accent but it has a “musical accent” known as pitch-accent. 

Pitch-accent is a decrease or increase in the tone of voice between syllables in a single word. Our technology analyzes pitch patterns of your voice and compares them to the proper pitch patterns of a native speaker. Then it presents your pronunciation visually in the form of a ""wave"". The wave indicates the highs and lows of the pitch. 

It helps you to compare your pronunciation not only by audio but also visually by comparing your “wave” with the “wave” of the native speaker.

By following visualized pronunciation you will see the actual patterns of the Japanese speech and learn proper pronunciation much faster than you would do just by listening. 

Everyday, Aomi provides you with a training, which consists of expressions that native speakers use in their daily life + the examples of how those expressions can be used. 

As you continue practicing day after day, you will naturally develop a proper articulation, which will make you sound like a native speaker. And your speech will be enriched with useful vocabulary that can’t be found in an ordinary textbook. 

All the materials from Trainings will be accessible to you in the app's “Glossary”. You can practice pronunciation of any word or phrase as much as you want at any time, anywhere. 

In addition to Training and Glossary you can freely explore and practice slang, loan words, tongue twisters and many other words and phrases that will boost your speaking skills even further.

Practicing with Aomi everyday you will create your personal language environment free of any embarrassment, available to you at any time, anywhere. 

=======================


PLEASE NOTE:

To access all Trainings and features of Aomi Japanese app you will need to have a subscription. You can always try the app for free with a limited access. 

• Payment will be charged to Google Play at confirmation of purchase.
• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal

Vocabulary Builder: 
Vocab builder feature in WordUp utilizes advanced algorithms to expand vocabulary and improve English skills. It recommends a new word each day based on your current knowledge, allowing you to gradually enhance your language proficiency. By incorporating daily words into your learning routine, WordUp ensures steady and consistent growth in your vocabulary.

Knowledge Map
WordUp helps you build a map of your knowledge by identifying the words you know and the words you don't know. It helps you learn new words by identifying the gaps in your vocabulary and suggesting the most important and useful English words to focus on. By incorporating daily vocabulary and tracking your progress, the Knowledge Map enables you to steadily increase your vocabulary and enhance your understanding of English words.
All 25,000 useful English words are ranked in the order of IMPORTANCE, and USEFULNESS, based on how often they are used in real-world spoken English (extracted from thousands of movies, and TV shows).

To actually learn the words that you discover in your Knowledge Map, WordUp gives you everything you need, and more! From word definitions and pictures to tens of entertaining examples from movies, quotes, news, and more. So you get a good feel of how to use each word in context. 

Multilingual Translations
There are also translations in more than 30 languages including French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, ...

The daily reviews then kick in. Like flashcards, the words will come back with games and challenges until you master them. It's called Spaced Repetition, and it's scientifically proven to help memorise them forever!

WordUp is unlike any vocabulary builder app you've seen before. It is not another dictionary app, although it can be used as an English dictionary too.

com.atistudios.mondly.id,Speak & Learn Indonesian,"Learn Indonesian with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the Indonesian language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core Indonesian words, form sentences, learn to speak Indonesian phrases and take part in conversations. Fun Indonesian lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule? The app works great and dynamically adjusts to your needs.

Explore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own Indonesian language tutor in your pocket.
Download the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.

<b>The secret path to language learning</b>
Remember the Indonesian language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Indonesian grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.

<b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b>
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Indonesian phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:

<b>Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right Indonesian pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

<b>State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Indonesian words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Indonesian clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

<b>Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Indonesian. Mondly teaches you Indonesian vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.

<b>Learn conversational Indonesian.</b> Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Indonesian vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Indonesian clearly.

<b>Verb conjugations.</b> If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Indonesian verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

<b>Advanced Statistics.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.

<b>The Leaderboard.</b> See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

<b>Adaptive Learning.</b> Learning Indonesian is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.

Before you know it, at the end of these Indonesian lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.",154446,4.65,3943.0,"[{'name': 'Education', 'id': 'EDUCATION'}]",315.0,0,learn indonesian free lesson daili let mondli teach indonesian languag quickli effect just minut ll start memor core indonesian word form sentenc learn speak indonesian phrase take part convers fun indonesian lesson improv vocabulari grammar pronunci like no other languag learn method beginn advanc learner travel busi profession tight schedul work great dynam adjust need explor languag exercis read listen write speak enhanc dictionari verb conjug state art speech recognit technolog ll feel like have own indonesian languag tutor pocket download languag learn pill today enjoy benefit learn new languag life b secret path languag learn b rememb indonesian languag class school start hundr basic word express continu ton indonesian grammar lesson end full semest s languag cours could bare translat sentenc say hello foreign that s tradit way learn languag mondli ha differ approach that s opposit averag languag cours b thi how futur languag cours look like b get start basic convers between two peopl quickli start memor core word use them build sentenc phrase end minut modul are abl reconstruct that convers own voic s effect way learn indonesian phrase state art natur speech recognit space repetit algorithm make effect learn languag here are key featur that make mondli great tutor b crystal clear audio profession voic actor b learn right indonesian pronunci from convers between nativ speaker b state art speech recognit b mondli know exactli how listen indonesian word phrase will onli get posit feedback if speak indonesian clearli correctli thi will improv pronunci b use phrase real situat b memor hundr isol word not way go when come learn indonesian mondli teach indonesian vocabulari by offer core word phrase break learn process down into short lesson put them into theme pack b learn convers indonesian b convers main reason take thi free cours will help build core indonesian vocabulari wide use noun verb speak indonesian clearli b verb conjug b if want learn more dure thi cours just tap indonesian verb get full conjug screen includ translat s faster better than dictionari b advanc statist b use intellig report so can alway follow progress build vocabulari step by step becom better daili b leaderboard b see how friend are do compet peopl from all over world becom best learner mondli commun famili take weekli quiz becom even better b adapt learn b learn indonesian differ from person person so we taught learn from way learn after littl time spent togeth mondli will understand what suit best will becom own guid custom teacher befor know end these indonesian lesson will master most use word phrase will be fast lane learn new languag

He has been teaching the GRE for more than 10 years, runs a popular vocabulary series on YouTube and he’s also written an eBook on vocabulary. He is nigh unbeatable in Scrabble, or any other word game for that matter.


How well will I learn the words?

===

Academic research has found that memories are formed by repeated exposure to new information, so Magoosh’s flashcard app uses a spaced repetition system. Words you are learning will reappear frequently (occurring less frequently the better you know them) and words you already know won’t be repeated. The GRE word list is culled so that you focus on only the most important words.


Your practice will focus on the words that you need to review the most to make sure the words you learn will really stick.


What is Magoosh?

===

Magoosh is an online test prep company with a focus on teaching the GRE.


The Magoosh team blogs about GRE words, formulas, grammar, problem solving, quantitative reasoning, and reading comprehension along with GRE study guides and study tips.

Fun English lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule?

Explore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own English language tutor in your pocket.
Download the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.

<b>The secret path to language learning</b>
Remember the English language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of English grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.

<b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b>
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn English phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:

<b>Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right English pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

<b>State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your English words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak English clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

<b>Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning English. Mondly teaches you English vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.

<b>Learn conversational English.</b> Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core English vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak English clearly.

<b>Verb conjugations.</b> If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the English verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

<b>Advanced Statistics.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.

<b>The Leaderboard.</b> See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

<b>Adaptive Learning.</b> Learning English is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.

Before you know it, at the end of these English lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.",4559060,4.593985,104708.0,"[{'name': 'Education', 'id': 'EDUCATION'}]",285.0,0,learn english free lesson daili let mondli teach english languag quickli effect just minut ll start memor core english word form sentenc learn speak english phrase take part convers fun english lesson improv vocabulari grammar pronunci like no other languag learn method beginn advanc learner travel busi profession tight schedul work great dynam adjust need explor languag exercis read listen write speak enhanc dictionari verb conjug state art speech recognit technolog ll feel like have own english languag tutor pocket download languag learn pill today enjoy benefit learn new languag life b secret path languag learn b rememb english languag class school start hundr basic word express continu ton english grammar lesson end full semest s languag cours could bare translat sentenc say hello foreign that s tradit way learn languag mondli ha differ approach that s opposit averag languag cours b thi how futur languag cours look like b get start basic convers between two peopl quickli start memor core word use them build sentenc phrase end minut modul are abl reconstruct that convers own voic s effect way learn english phrase state art natur speech recognit space repetit algorithm make effect learn languag here are key featur that make mondli great tutor b crystal clear audio profession voic actor b learn right english pronunci from convers between nativ speaker b state art speech recognit b mondli know exactli how listen english word phrase will onli get posit feedback if speak english clearli correctli thi will improv pronunci b use phrase real situat b memor hundr isol word not way go when come learn english mondli teach english vocabulari by offer core word phrase break learn process down into short lesson put them into theme pack b learn convers english b convers main reason take thi free cours will help build core english vocabulari wide use noun verb speak english clearli b verb conjug b if want learn more dure thi cours just tap english verb get full conjug screen includ translat s faster better than dictionari b advanc statist b use intellig report so can alway follow progress build vocabulari step by step becom better daili b leaderboard b see how friend are do compet peopl from all over world becom best learner mondli commun famili take weekli quiz becom even better b adapt learn b learn english differ from person person so we taught learn from way learn after littl time spent togeth mondli will understand what suit best will becom own guid custom teacher befor know end these english lesson will master most use word phrase will be fast lane learn new languag

com.db.lingotv,Japanese Speak: Aoi,"You're still struggling with your speaking even though you've studied Japanese for a long time?

You have high JLPT scores but you can't keep a conversation with a native speaker for more than 3 minutes?

It's a simple truth that most people just can't seem to get good at speaking Japanese.

The problem is we never get a chance to practice speaking because we've only focused on grammar and exams.

-

Aoi process is simple:

1. Introduce you to Real Japanese that is essential to every day Japanese conversations

3. Simulate real situations where you’d actually use it

Whenever you’re using Aoi, you’ll be speaking a ton — and the app will always be listening and providing feedback to make sure you fix mistakes.

Just like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go in a pool instead of reading a swimming book, if you want to get good at Speaking Japanese, you’re gonna have to start actually speaking and do it every day! Aoi makes this realistic.

Aoi has 5 features that help learners improve Japanese speaking skills.

(1) Free Conversation: Aoi, equipped with ChatGPT and optimized for Japanese, can engage in role-playing conversations with learners in various scenarios, ensuring you excel in real-life Japanese communication.

(2) Pronunciation Correction: With the most advanced voice recognition AI, it can instantly judge and correct learners' pronunciation, making your Japanese accent closer to that of native speakers.

com.Hello_Hello_Japanese,Learn Japanese with HelloHello,"Hello-Hello Japanese is the FUN way to learn a Language on the Go!

Hello-Hello Japanese is a full-fledged language course with 30 LESSONS developed in collaboration with the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), so you can be assured that these lessons follow an effective research-based methodology. All lessons are conversational based on realistic dialogues and situations, rather than a collection of out-of-context words and phrases.

All the content is stored in the app so that you have great responsiveness when you are ready to learn a language. You do not need to be connected to Wi-Fi or 3G networks to run the app. With Hello-Hello Japanese you will be able to do the lessons and practice vocabulary anytime, anywhere developing all the skills you need to communicate in a foreign language. All lessons were recorded by native speakers so you can learn the correct pronunciation.

With Hello-Hello Japanese you can also:

Practice vocabulary with more than 300 words and phrases using our FLASHCARDS feature!  (Please note that we will be adding more words and phrases in upcoming updates.)

Save your own NOTES form any lesson.

Full localization: You can see the entire app, including the translations of the lessons and words lists in your native language! Languages available: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese and Portuguese.
 
Note about our methodology: At first, our lessons might seem advanced for some people but there is a purpose behind it. Our lessons are structured to give learners the ability to communicate effectively with others.  If the learner is new to the language, it will be necessary to spend more time learning the basic phrases in order to begin to gain proficiency in the language.  For those who already know other related languages, the time factor may not be as great to learn the basics. Beginners need to go slowly and may need to do the activities several times before they gain a comfort level in using them. And remember: The more time you spend doing the exercises, the more proficient you will become!

CONTACT US:  We are constantly trying to improve the app and take feedback from our users very seriously. The app has a “Contact Us” icon so that you can contact us easily, so please do not hesitate and send us an email if you have any questions, comments, complaints or suggestions.

com.lin.duo.hd.french,French for Beginners: LinDuo,"<b>ADVANTAGES OF OUR APP:</b>
* Pronunciation by a native speaker
* 2375 words split into 180 topic lessons
* Does not require permanent Internet connection
* Beautiful illustrations for each word
* Phonetic transcription for each word
* Dark interface to study at night
* Choose from male and female voice
* Built in app dictionary with progress
* Game ""True or False"" to review pas material
* Special lessons with favorite, difficult, old, random words
* Flexible sound settings (music, speaker, effects)
* Just 10-15 minutes per day to learn all words
* For adults and teens 13+

<b>Only 10-15 minutes per day</b> Spending just 10-15 minutes every day, will easily allow you to remember all useful French words. While memorizing words, the frequency of lesson is more important than duration of each lesson. 10 minutes on each day of the week will be more productive than one hour of tuition a week.

<b>One minute lessons</b> Taking into account busyness of modern life, we designed each lesson in the way so it would never take more than one minute to complete it! So you no longer need to search for free time to practice French! Simply, once you get a chance, launch the app and do one lesson at a time =)

<b>Only useful French words</b> French for Beginners: LinDuo HD is a free and quick start to learn French language! Unlike others, we have only the most useful words, which are divided into 180 topic based lessons. Quality is here!

Teach-yourself French is designed, that it will use your visual and echoic memory to help you memorize French words fast and easy!

<b>Special illustrations</b> We use only specially developed infographics (developed by psychologists), so your eyes can quickly identify meaning of word or action without stressing them with small unnecessary details.

<b>Word pronunciation by native speakers</b> Our app will help you master pronunciation of French words! Each word is recording by professional native speaker! Additionally, in the settings you can choose between male or female voice.

<b>Dynamic lesson difficulty</b> The app changes lesson difficulty gradually as you progress. To achieve this, it keeps stats for EVERY word! Example: in the spelling mode, initially you need to insert several missing letters in a word, then create a word having extra letters and finally, when you are ready, you will need to type the entire word on the keyboard.

<b>Modes for quick learning</b> The App includes four additional lesson types which are made of Favorites, Difficult, Old, Random words. You can add any word to your favorites and later create custom lesson from your Favorite words. Words are automatically added to ""Difficult"" (the ones you struggle to memorize) and ""Old"" (which you have not reviewed for a long time) sections. A ""Random"" mode will create a unique lesson.

<b>Do not need to know how to read</b> If you cannot read yet, no problem! Each word has a transcription in your language! And for more experienced ones, in the settings, you can choose a phonetic (like in a dictionary) transcription.

<b>Additional features</b> Thanks to your reviews, we are constantly updating the app to make it better! To help you take care of your eyesight, with just one tap, you can activate dark theme. If you temporarily do not have internet access, no problem! The App can work offline as well!

<b>Review Past Material</b> Many good apps do not pay enough attention to review past material! For this purpose we created the word game ""True or False"". It is very simple, but it's addictive and the most importantly, it helps to repeat past material and never to forget it!

<b>Support and Contact Us</b>
If you have any questions or suggestions, please never hesitate to send us an email <b>admin@lin-duo.com</b>!

Thanks to simple guided instruction, you’ll not only experience your child mastering each phonics lesson, but will also foster a lifelong love of reading you can share together.

<b>By lesson 10, your kid will be reading their first book!</b>

<h2>THE MOST MEANINGFUL (TEAM)WORK OF YOUR LIFE</h2>

<b>Each phonics lesson takes just 15 - 20 minutes to complete</b> and they’re designed for you and your child to go at your own pace.

2️⃣ BLENDING LETTERS
In this phase, your kid will use their knowledge of letter-sounds to begin blending letters together to read words. Your child will become adept at using our sound sliders to support them in decoding words with short vowel sounds and both slow & fast consonants.

3️⃣ READING BOOKS
Once your child has a foundation in word-blending skills, it’s time to read books! Together you will read fun and engaging stories, reveal hidden pictures, and check for understanding by answering comprehension questions.

4️⃣ ADVANCED DECODING
In this phase, your kid will learn about long vowel sounds, digraphs, and irregular sight words, as well as how to approach common types of punctuation.

5️⃣ READING FLUENCY

com.reallifeglobal.app,"RealLife: Speak, Learn English","The last English learning app you will ever need!

If you ever feel frustrated because you do not understand fast-speaking natives, you forget new expressions, you freeze up in conversation (not knowing the right word), or you do not feel confident and natural speaking, then download RealLife English now! Just look how it helped this learner:

""…my English isn't perfect… but the app has really helped me to build up my vocabulary. Sometimes I'm having conversations with my colleagues who are natives. When I listen to a word that I learned using the app, I just feel really, really happy because I'm making improvements. It also helped me to improve my pronunciation…. specifically, about the connected speech and how I should pronounce it. I'm trying to focus my efforts on that. I feel like I'm going to achieve my goals if I continue using the app.” (Daniel G. 🇲🇽)

Most classes and apps promise you fluency in months, but then do not prepare you for real-life, everyday situations. You’re left stuck, your English does not flow. 

Our global team of language learning experts is committed to creating tools for English learners like you that actually work so you can:
–Always remember the right word at the right time
–Understand practically 100% of what natives say
–Speak English effortlessly and clearly in any situation without fear or mistakes
–Unlock new opportunities in your life.

➡️ How it works:

1. 👂🏼LEARN—We have a huge variety of FUN real-life conversation videos where you’ll learn English you’ll actually use in your everyday life, while developing your listening to understand fast-native speech and vocabulary
2. 🧠 PRACTICE—Watching each lesson, you will unlock Vocabulary Flashcards with the new advanced expressions that you need for your life. These use innovative technology that helps you never forget the new expressions
3. 🗣️ SPEAK—Actually use your English and discover other cultures in conversations with real people from around the world in the Global Speak. It’s okay if you are shy. The first two steps will help you build your confidence and develop the skills to communicate naturally in any situation without fear or mistakes. Take your time.

👉🏼 When you first download the app, to get the best experience we highly recommend you join the free RealLife Way Mini-Course, which will introduce you to our popular method and help you be successful!

_____________________

<h2><b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b></h2>
Our French language learning app gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn French phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make our French learning app effective for learning languages.

<h2><b>Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:</b></h2>
✓ Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.
» Learn the right French pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

✓ State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.
» Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your French words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak French clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

✓ Useful phrases for real situations.
» Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning French. Mondly teaches you French vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. Our French language learning apps break the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.

✓ Learn conversational French.
» Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core French vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak French clearly.

✓ Verb conjugations.
» If you want to learn French grammar during this course, just tap the French verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

✓ Advanced Statistics.
» Our French learning apps use intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.

✓ The Leaderboard.
» See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

✓ Adaptive Learning.
» Learning French is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.

★ Before you know it, at the end of these French lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.
