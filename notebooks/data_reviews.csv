com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,best for struggling learners and really helps u understand
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"great app, when I'm an adult and have my own money I'll consider getting a subscription. the daily lesson is nice. what you do is incredible, the variety is huge. just please add Yakut/Sakha language? there are no apps that teach it 😞😞😞"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"My absolute favorite language learning app. The lessons make the words easy to understand and memorize. Never before have I enjoyed trying a new language, especially Turkmen, which I struggled with prior."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,this app very useful
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"This is the best, by far, language learning app that I have ever used."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,c'est utile pour les débutants comme moi
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,this is an excellent app to learn what your saying in a new app
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I love this app. I can learn multiple languages at the same time. It's free but if you want to learn more then you have to buy it. I'm learning Algerian darija which is just a dialect and it is so challenging to find an app to learn it but BlueBird has made it easy for me. I've learned so many useful words and phrases from BlueBird. Thank you!
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"Fuer einfache Konversation ist die App optimal.Wer aber eine Sprache fluessig sprechen willl ,kommt auch mit dieser App nicht weit."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I love it it's so easy to learn with it but its missing languages I need to learn like tongan and maori or other pacific languages other wise it would of been a 5 stars
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I love this app and I'm glad of it..
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I've tried a number of language apps and this is definitely my top pick. Favorite part is that the lessons are set up with a ton of speaking practice.
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,Mostly a great app! 👍🏻
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"This is awesome and totally free to use with any library card. The choice of languages is absolutely amazing. No ads! Legit a fun free way to try any language. Even types of dialects.... I'm still laughing because I need to brush up on my ""Scottish English"" for example. Try it!"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"the first word ""Free"" is fraudulent. except for the first word in each section, you got to pay for buying the courses. so the description is wrong."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"it's an excellent app that I have ever used in my life to learn languages, it's so amazing and practical. I would like to suggest that the app developers add the Bosnian language, which will make it the best , the Bosnian language is uncommon in most great apps like Blue Bird , I hope to get a reply on my review and I wish to see the Bosnian language between all these languages to learn it😊"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,تتطبق ممتاز لتعلم اللغة الكردية مع النطق
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,this is the best app if you are looking for improving listenibg.
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,very helpful in learning correct pronunciations and use of words.
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,Not really there yet.
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"Thanks, i still havent learned anything yet, but when summer comes, ill learn Japanese, besides it helps my future"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,موجود مشكلة في التطبيق اليوم لا يفتح بسبب فيروس بداخله حذفته وقمت بتحميله مرة أخرى نفس الشيء لا أعرف المشكلة في التطبيق او في الجهاز
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,Am looking for a language app. the interface for flashcards sucks. you can't tap the screen to show the foreign word. you have it rate your u derstanding. highly disruptive. poorly done. could be tap to show answer; swipe right for next. rate the word. edit: fair response.
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"buena app para aprender idiomas, la recomiendo"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"Bluebird’s Limitations: No Generative Practice: -Memorizing ""I ate rice"" doesn’t teach you to create ""She will cook soup"" unless the app trains sentence structure manipulation. Limited Contextual Variety: -Pre-set phrases may not cover diverse scenarios (e.g., storytelling, hypotheticals), leaving gaps in applying tenses flexibly. Passive Learning: Focuses on recognition/repetition, not active creation of sentences."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I actually wanna go back to school for real. spot on blue bird w
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"Great for pronunciation. I've only been on a few days, at the 'no cost' level. It seems great so far."
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"I really like this app, and it's really useful but I just wish they had the alphabets as well, makes it so much easier to understand which sounds correlate with them"
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,I would have to say that *It is actually THE BEST LANGUAGE LEARNING PRESENT on the play store right now *. 😃 Features ⚙️ : 1. Tons of vocab for FREE 🫡🤫 2. Almost all the languages that One could need to learn 📖 3. Fair Charges 💰
com.pronunciatorllc.bluebird,"Update: if you can't understand why having a robot shout over the language practice is bad & not improved by switching robots, I can't dumb it down enough for you to figure out. And being snide is no way to get a lost customer to do your job for you. The (audio only) lessens get you into the habit of repeating after the native speaker, only for the obnoxiously chipper American (in my case) to suddenly start shouting the next prompt over you because they didn't bother to leave time at the end."

After paying the monthly subscription fees for Duolingo and Memrise for years, I stumbled across this app and was finally able to drop those subscription fees and pay one lifetime fee. Over 2,000 words is quite a good amount, as these words are the majority of words one might run across in everyday life."

learn.words.learn.english,I just installed this app and I found that it has some good features. The spoken voice is very clear and easily understood. The phonics are a great idea grouping words in a way that you can remember other words if you forget how to spell a word you want to use. I have not spent enough time using this app has yet but so far it seems to be a good way to lmprove learning.

ai.talkpal,Can't do anything at all without paying.
ai.talkpal,thank you so much
ai.talkpal,nice app
ai.talkpal,"For simple conversation only, it doesn't have memory in call mode.."
ai.talkpal,this is good
ai.talkpal,needs Luxembourgish.
ai.talkpal,The app is useless. I chose to learn Bosnian. So the app started off speaking to me in Bosnian. Multiple complete phrases asking me questions without translation. I am supposed to understand and answer those despite specifying learning from 0 in settings. The company has tried to take down my reviews both here and at Trustpilot. The total score is clearly inflated — most of their 5-star reviews at Trustpilot are from users without other reviews.
ai.talkpal,"Free basic feature have nothing that make your learning improve, If you don't have budget for this app, don't waste time by installing it, Thank you"
ai.talkpal,"I downloaded and signed up for 2 years in order to perfect my pronunciation of Vietnamese. in lesson 1 (xin chào), the pronunciation of ""xin"" is different on the intro page (~ chin) and the following page (~sin or ~zin)...THIS IS A BAD START. Voice is too fast (unadjustable on android?) to be able to catch the nuances of the Vietnamese language (multiple tones). Explanations are non existent for what you did wrong pronunciation wise (too high, too low, wrong tone, etc). Too many issues to list."
ai.talkpal,"I think talkpal is great app to use especially if you want to improve any language you want to improve, it's just that it wants money but fortunately you can have a free trial"
ai.talkpal,literally couldn't take a lesson without paying
ai.talkpal,it's pay to learn.
ai.talkpal,"I just started using it, and I like it because it's funny and easy"
ai.talkpal,literally has nothing
ai.talkpal,it's nice
ai.talkpal,Good
ai.talkpal,It's really nice to improve fluency
ai.talkpal,"Not all languages have courses i.e. Serbian. You can see markdowns like ""**"" in conversations, and they never end. You can endlessly say buy to each other, conversation task is never completed."
ai.talkpal,good
ai.talkpal,good 👍
ai.talkpal,"I use it to learn Dutch, but the corrections it gives me aren't accurate anymore. I feel like it has degraded in quality recently."
ai.talkpal,excellent
ai.talkpal,It shows that this app IS FREE but the only problem is that I have to pay which SUCKS and they litterly false advertising saying that this app has no pay plans or no pre paid plans (its free) but its not free
ai.talkpal,WARNING — Overcharged. Sale showed 2500 RSD (75% off) but I was charged 7700 RSD when I tapped buy. This is an incorrect/unauthorized charge. I want a refund and an explanation — do not trust this purchase flow.
ai.talkpal,"I like that this app has the option to chat with different historical figures, gods and fictional characters. I don't particularly care for Emma the AI tutor that much. The lessons are okay. I'm going to go to Busuu. Maybe I'll come back to this later."
ai.talkpal,Awesome
ai.talkpal,l used to enjoy this app but my European Portuguese AI teacher suddenly switched to Brazilian Portuguese and l can't figure a way out of it. (My settings still show European Portuguese)
ai.talkpal,"I love this app. I have learned so much more Italian in just 2 weeks than I learned in a year, in terms of grammar, forming sentences, pronunciation and conjugation of verbs. The variation and feedback is excellent!! I highly recommend this app."
ai.talkpal,very good app
ai.talkpal,excellent
com.knudge.me,This is very nice for me
com.knudge.me,brain exercise
com.knudge.me,this is the worst app .. because it doesn't unlock the new words..I wasted my money on it
com.knudge.me,I love this app. Because their method are unique.
com.knudge.me,Learning with this app is delectable. You deserve 10 stars out of 5.
com.knudge.me,"Hi, it works for me if the word has pictures to illustrate it. I really love it, please, if all of the words have pictures I will give 5 stars!"
com.knudge.me,"This is a wonderful application, definitely made by some geniuses... An improvement in it can be more helpful to the learners and that is, as there on the top of the page on the word card the thorough meaning is already mentioned below the word on top, so it could be the best one if there may be some explanatory detailed meaning in the meaning section which may help them who could not understand it properly only with the help of thorough meaning on top. Rest all is the best."
com.knudge.me,Good app loving it
com.knudge.me,parts of the screen are covered up buy on screen buttons such as III O V
com.knudge.me,repetitive
com.knudge.me,Exceptional!!! ✴️
com.knudge.me,it's very helpful I learned more new vocabularies which gave me confidence
com.knudge.me,the UI overlaps the phone buttons on screen. how can any one navigate of the star button overlaps the home button of the phone. i don't understand what the developers are thinking before placing it so close.
com.knudge.me,This app is consistently improving my abilities.
com.knudge.me,Best app I've ever used in any context.
com.knudge.me,"They took away my lifetime pro membership, and again want me to pay for pro membership."
com.knudge.me,best app out there for vocab. Fast and simple. some of the infographics are ingenious. well done!
com.knudge.me,"The best app to learn new words with an interactive method, and spending multiple activities just to learn a single word is helpful. find"
com.knudge.me,Best app
com.knudge.me,"the most beautiful thing that I like about the apps is their UI, and the graphics shown with the flashcards, these graphics are very relevant to the word"
com.knudge.me,best app
com.knudge.me,best👍
com.knudge.me,"please help, i've been download and purchasing for lifetime, then the app error conection and need to upgrade pro again"
com.knudge.me,"This seems unfair, I had paid for a lifetime subscription because this app was offering so many good things and not only vocabulary. there used to be a quiz, tenses and grammar lessons, now this has very basic information."
com.knudge.me,"would be better if i could get more credits nd more credits to use per day and get more cards, still an amazing app , a solid 9/10"
com.knudge.me,i like it
com.knudge.me,I have been there since the launch of the app. What happened to you? You were such a great app. People loved you. Where did you go? Why did you stop posting content in the app?
com.knudge.me,"Amazing, everything in one single app, vocabulary, practice, any what you want to learn words and meaning, everyday, I recommend this."
com.knudge.me,I am always bored to learn English but the Knudge app is so interesting that it helps me a lot highly recommended 🙂
com.knudge.me,Why do I need to unlock other chapters with 20 credits? Should I use it for learning something or is it a premium game?
com.wonder,I have my money now thank you sorry for some inconvenience
com.wonder,top
com.wonder,"literally can't access 95% of the content with out paying, it's only like 2$(round up) but like wow I can only do one thing on there once a day."
com.wonder,So far it's fun.I just play to brush up on my learning
com.wonder,very beautiful app and games. the premium is really helpful and Brain tasking.
com.wonder,a great way to refresh your memory and learn a new thing or two!
com.wonder,Great way to stimulate your mind!
com.wonder,"unsubscribed after trying it and was charged again this month, not very professional.."
com.wonder,"this is a 7 day trial app! There were no options to enjoy without paying. I do however think I WOULD have liked it, but not for $10 bucks a month so instead of giving my card and hoping I could stop the subscription in time before the 7 day trial, I just uninstalled. waste of time"
com.wonder,Defiently useful games for keeping your mind sharp! Practical too!
com.wonder,it's have same fun
com.wonder,"I love this cache of mind games! It's fresh, fun, challenging and a little hard!"
com.wonder,Correct answers were not available in quiz options. And othing happens when I clicked button after initial quiz
com.wonder,the goal of a test is sometimes confusing
com.wonder,"Actually uses real life scenarios. Teaches you the right way to do something if you are confused or get an answer wrong, and it'll explain in simple language lol. Touches all subjects to work on to be a better version of yourself. Thank you Elevate!"
com.wonder,"I'm happy with this app. It helps with neuroplasticity and keeps me in good mental health. after a TBI and two brain surgeries I have some disability. I need the exercise to maintain retention and prevent Alzheimer's, dementia, and cognitive impairment."
com.wonder,be warned that if you sign up for 7 day trial they'll charge your 1 month when you cancel even if within an hour
com.wonder,really really good at keeping my brain active and letting me learn a bit everyday
com.wonder,"Excellent value for the annual plan, and enough variety to stir that dopamine pot, encouraging further engagement. 😉👍"
com.wonder,worth every penny
com.wonder,"this app has had connectivity issues for about a week now as if 1/18/26 and it seems as though they are doing nothing to fix it despite uninstalling the app, going through all the troubleshooting steps, and contacting support. on droid the app hasn't loaded in a week and on iPhone you have to reinstall it every day. Will update rating when this gets fixed"
com.wonder,perfect app 🔥
com.wonder,"The app is great. It helps me hone my linguistic as well analytical skiils. However, it would be helpful if you have the laptop version of it as well. I will give 5 stars then"
com.wonder,This game is addictive!
com.wonder,really great way to start my morning
com.wonder,Love how urgent the timed exercises are but how gently the difficulty ramps up. I will buy premium as soon as I can afford it and use it daily. ❤️
com.wonder,To good not to try
com.wonder,"Good fun, love it. challenging at times"
com.wonder,"Till today the application was excellent for me. However, starting from today the app keeps failing to start. It opens and closes a moment after. There wasn't any update so far. And I have paid membership, so what am I paying for? And my progress is also going to be lost, what a pity."
com.wonder,Lessons are not forced on you. You go at the speed you want with options to increase or decrease difficulty. Lessons are varied and challenging. HIGHLY recommended!

com.soundcloud.android,"I love sound cloud , and I've had content from my beginning to the present day. It's amazing. The transformation from being a newbie to developing into a quality sounding artist , I appreciate every artist that has influenced my style , of singing , rapping, or writing. Every song has a piece of them inside it, without the ones before you , to guide you , where do you start?"
com.soundcloud.android,has every single one of my favorite songs <3
com.soundcloud.android,sick. free music? oh yea
com.soundcloud.android,tukie the squadfather loves it
com.soundcloud.android,song are not available in my country ksa why ??!! dreams by Fleetwood Mac
com.soundcloud.android,I do love this app and use daily but I am not getting any answer to why I suddenly can't add tracks to my set playlists. before there was a save button that you had to press once it was added. now it isn't there. any advice would be great
com.soundcloud.android,my app is not showing anything but a black screen after I pick the 3 artists.
com.soundcloud.android,"Not bad but it's slow ,I don't even get my own interests"

com.soundcloud.android,good experience
tv.englishclub.b2c,I believe that the app has improved with the new update. Thanks 🙂
tv.englishclub.b2c,"I’ve been a paid ECTV subscriber for a long time and really appreciate the high-quality and useful content. The new “On Mind” channel is a great addition! However, the Android app has two issues that need attention: 1. Offline mode no longer works — downloaded videos cannot be played without internet. This used to work before. 2. It would be very helpful to have audio playback when the screen is locked (background mode). Otherwise, great app and content — hoping for these improvements soon!"
tv.englishclub.b2c,"It would be better, if the app can be installed on android tvs. Then, I can easily decide to buy it."
tv.englishclub.b2c,very excited 😊

com.atistudios.mondly.languages,terrible app absolutely useless for intermediate learners also it constantly suggests premium package stay away!
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,too much spam to get the paid subscription. please stop requesting it so often.
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,I like the app
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,really creative and great i just like that
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,needs Luxembourgish
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,this helped me pass Afrikaans as a proud black person not to be racist
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,good
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,I LOVE LANGUAGES AND FLAGS AND COUNTRY
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"You don't have the Serbian language as offer, Serbian and Croatioan are not the same, there are plenty off better app that offer all languages"
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,vary good
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,cannot create an account. doesn't allow me
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"it is very very useful and helpful I love it so much,although I would preference if the voice detection works better"
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"Out of all the Bulgarian apps I've come across, this app makes it fun and easy to use. Not only is it very informative, but it makes me want to learn Bulgarian even more."
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,Best Language Learning app ever
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"This app makes learning languages genuinely fun and effortless. The interactive design keeps you fully engaged and the lessons are structured in a way that helps new words stick naturally. I especially love the Speaking option, helps you practice speaking and improves pronunciation. The Words section gives u chance to review and provides also grammar. Nothing feels boring, it s perfect for anyone who wants to learn and remember a new language with ease."
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,My subscription was not activated even after payment. Support team is not responding to email's. Very bad experience.
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,AI pronunciation needs improvement. I wish they used native speakers to guarantee proper pronunciation. Lessons feel rushed without enough focus on vocabulary building. You are thrown into sentences too quickly without learning the words surrounding the nouns. It makes it difficult to retain the other parts of the sentence. The app would really benefit from a proper chat function. It should also include word 'history' telling you the root of the word and the ACTUAL translation of a sentence.
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"This is one very good language learning app! I'm learning German SUPER fast! I've been learning Spanish at school, but I just wanted to learn Spanish faster :3. For French, I am not really that good at learning it because they don't teach that at my school, but they do at my brother's school. I'm learning French and German for travel, but Spanish is just to improve my grade in school. I would recommend learning languages on this app because it's better than just learning languages at school"
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,good 👍
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,w app
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,Very hard to cancel the this subscription 😞😞😞
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"All words appear in phonetic spelling instead of in the language you are learning, which is really annoying. And there does not seem to be a way to choose between learning the actual alphabet and language or learning it via this strange phonetic spelling, which does not actually match the pronunciation."
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"Polyglot here. Courses are...okay. Enough to pique my interest. The lifetime subscription does not give access to future languages they add. It cannot be paid through Play Store, so you can't get points for it. Every menu item for the phone support number to pay for the app just says to email support. Support confirmed via email. Pearson has always been terrible and I'm not even going to bother discussing the lack of accessibility."
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,the algorithm struggles to catch pronunciation at times and just fills in the blank with some that wasn't even remotely said but over pretty good
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"It doesn't track our weak words automatically, we have to do it manually but other than that everything is perfecto👌"
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,Interesting
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"having tried them all, unfortunately I'm ready to cancel this one too. All very same same. words and phrases not at all relevant to what I need to say. i just think A.Is like Chat GPT will do it better in the future. You'll be able to choose custom sentences and be prompted to learn those lines until it sinks in. The AI feature on this is awful. Good idea, bad execution. Yeah not for me. Retaining the information doesn't work for me. After one day I just know its not for me."
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"the app is very basic, probably AI driven in the back end. It presents you with a question and the answer on the same screen, then leaps into conversational questions with zero explanation. Go look on YouTube, there's far better content on ""I love thais"" educational content than this rubbish. don't waste your money"
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"I can't believe i founded a correct app,best!!"
com.atistudios.mondly.languages,"Great,but there should be always an option to buy program for eternity!"
com.eup.migiitoeic,need pay at least $20 to use this app

com.eup.migiitoeic,第一次留app評論就給你們了 看到網路上的英文老師推薦，就買了永久的會員，還不便宜，沒想到竟然練習的模擬試題詳解都無法看。 有寫信回報，來回了兩三封信之後就音訊全無，我還很配合，需要錄影、截圖傳給你們看我這邊看到的狀況的我都傳了，然後就沒有消息了，好歹也要告訴我你們有在處理，需要一點時間，不然我怎麼知道你們有沒有收到，有沒有在處理？ 今天看到更新，我重新試了一遍，整個模擬試題只有part1.2可以看到詳解，其他的依然看不到。 另外有一些每日練習題也會沒有詳解！！ 不是標榜會員能看詳解嗎？結果詳解都不能看...那我花這個錢買你們的app作用何在？ 我的第一封信是5/14傳的，至今已過了超過兩週的時間，依然無法解決問題。
com.eup.migiitoeic,"Very Good And Fun application to learning English, and quite closed to Toeic test! unfortunately there's premium price that so Expensive!"
com.eup.migiitoeic,gooddd
com.eup.migiitoeic,Overall good but the quiz system is always contains bugs. I choose one option but the software put different answer after submission. please fix this bug so it will be a better quiz system.

com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,Cancelled twice and they continued to bill me! I sent them a message and they finally cancelled ( Supposedly) but have not received a refund. Do not trust this company.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,I am so sick and tired of paying for this course that I have no control over how much I pay of for how long. you made cancel of the subscription over difficult to achieve. I want to cancel my subscription please
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"I’m learning Japanese and currently at Level 2 with Pimsleur. A hands-free AI tutor using this same speaking-first method would make this app one of the best language-learning tools available. Full lesson transcripts with selectable words to add to a master flashcard deck would be amazing. Adjustable playback speed and slightly tighter spaced repetition would also help. I review the previous lesson before moving on. Overall, it’s worth the money and very effective, especially at the beginning."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"good App, highly recommended for Arabic learners."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,keep processing my bill even I didn't use this app
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,learning with it.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,too expensive
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"Pros - Main lessons are audio only, great for driving. - Very effective for me, though I did already learn the basics elsewhere. - Regularly changes up how words and grammar get used, rather than using the same phrases over and over. Quirks - Doesn't teach much grammar directly, letting you figure out the patterns. Cons - Audio lessons aren't properly interactive. - ❗Forward and back on Bluetooth devices skips between lessons rather than seconds.❗"
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"Broken app. Buggy and glitchy. Freezes up. Also be prepared to restart whatever language you've been studying. You can't course select, this might be a bug"
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"I should say I'm learning Chinese Mandarin using this. They seperate the listening and reading/writing. I feel like I'm being taught at half speed. I don't want to stare at a ""free daily lesson timer"" while waiting for the AI robot voice to finish talking. Sometimes I don't hear properly and being able to read things like if it was a N noise or M noise, or B or P.. I'm hoping they add a feature to read what you're saying so I'll keep it installed for now. It seems like a good app for what it is."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"I was interested in an app that would allow me to practice my German. To the question ""How much German do you know"" I answered ""a lot"". The app then forced me to start at lesson 1 anyway, impossible to get ANY other lesson without paying. I tried the ""challenge"" mode where you have to speak into your microphone. The AI did pick up what I was saying, but some translations are bad: for example, for ""I understand English"" the expected translation was ""Ich verstehe"". As if ""English"" was extra... :("
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,awesome
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,The best app in the world 🌎🌎🌍
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,Terrible customer service. Designed to delay you until you give up. I am currently on my 4th attempt to be paid back money they took from my card without my consent. There is literally no difference from stealing money from your customers at this point.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"My favorite language app. I used many. Years back I bought several language course when it came in cassette tape. They were quite good but the lack of ways to review material other than listening to the tapes was a huge downside for me. This app solves that though now it seems there are too many review options. some people are never happy 😁😁 I wish it just had 2 or 3 choices for review. previous lessons, and the current lesson with a choice to select sentences that can be reviewed separately."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,The voice coach is irritating. they need to improve the voice recognition. the rest of the product os good
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,I LOVED Pimsleur when I used it to learn Brazilian Portuguese after I had moved there. it was perfect for me dash shortage lessons that I could listen to while walking around the park or whatever else. I'm currently picking back up and trying to relearn Spanish and it seems much more fake than the Portuguese. I do not like that you are forcing me to leave a review in order to open a app after I just spent a lot of money on a lifetime subscription. that's incredibly annoying and cost you a star.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,I am easily learning German during my commute to and from work.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"Exceptional! I would recommend this app to anyone trying to learn a new language. I have learned more in 30 days of using Pimsleur than I have retained in all of my years of trying to learn Spanish from college courses, Babbel, Duolingo, Jumpspeak, Rosetta, etc. This method is the best. LOVE IT!"
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"Great app but there are no instruction on using the techniques. update 2026, same same but never got any upgrades or results"
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"this is a good app to help with learning language, but to learn more than how to greet someone you have to pay for the app, shouldn't be advertised as a free app."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"So information dense and lots of different ways to practice, by far the best language program I've used and Duolingo can go jump in the dumpster where it belongs. Pimsluers is 100 times better. There's also so much extra content around culture and specific situations, like being in the airport or at the market, and they explain the cultural relevancy to why you say things the way you say them. Definitely recommend. Buy the premium version, you won't be disappointed."
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,"this app makes it easy to learn a language at your own pace. it has lots of repetition and exercises to help with reading and writing. if you're serious about learning, do it methodically and stick with it and you'll learn!"
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,I like the hands free learning and repetion
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,learning way faster than any other app
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,I'm a Pimsleur old-timer from the days of cassette tapes and later CDs. The app is so much better and easier to use. The price is also a lot more reasonable now too.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,I took it for Farsi the very first language and every Iranian I ran into were impressed with my pronunciation and vocabulary.
com.simonandschuster.pimsleur.unified.android,Totally uninstalled. Not welcoming all countries. my country is not on the list for English learning. why don't you just make English learning for all!

us.nobarriers.elsa,great app for improve our English knowledge
us.nobarriers.elsa,Love it
us.nobarriers.elsa,that's awesome for practicing English
us.nobarriers.elsa,"Earlier versions were responsive and useful for improving pronunciation, with a convenient user interface. Unfortunately, the current version is inconvenient and lacks important features. For example, the ability to listen to my own voice has been removed. I would not recommend purchasing the app until these issues are fixed."
us.nobarriers.elsa,the app is really great
us.nobarriers.elsa,"Hi, I recently registered for your app and really enjoying using it! However I noticed during the setup that my native languange wasn't available in the list of options. Because I didn't want to stop using app. I chose anaother language for now, and I hoping you'll be adding many language in a future update. Thank you for your time and for creating such a helpful app."
us.nobarriers.elsa,very good
us.nobarriers.elsa,よいアプリだと思っていたが、ロールプレイがゴミ化した。 途中で発言が打ち切られたり、一部音声を無かったことにされたり、同じ単語を３連続で発音したことにさせられるので、練習にならない。
us.nobarriers.elsa,it's very nice
us.nobarriers.elsa,nice
us.nobarriers.elsa,perfect
us.nobarriers.elsa,it's basically a paid app!! Don't download it!
us.nobarriers.elsa,I like it
us.nobarriers.elsa,that's great it's just awesome
us.nobarriers.elsa,This app improves students who are bad at English.
us.nobarriers.elsa,it's easier to understand
us.nobarriers.elsa,good 👍😊
us.nobarriers.elsa,It is one of the best app to correct pronunciation and practice english words.
us.nobarriers.elsa,I think this app is great option to improve your vocabulary
us.nobarriers.elsa,it's helpful
us.nobarriers.elsa,at least
us.nobarriers.elsa,It has been a week since I took the premium subscription and still the app does not reflect the subscription. I have written to their support email address but there is no response. It appears that subscription is a scam. Never subscribe to this app.
us.nobarriers.elsa,I want to practice conversational English. Please point out my errors as we speak so I can learn. I’d like to keep it natural and​ consistent​ Everyday.
us.nobarriers.elsa,Something went wrong with ELSA Speak ELSA Speak closed because this app has a bug. Try updating this app after its developer provides a fix for this error. Got it
us.nobarriers.elsa,アップデートで毎回アプリを起動するときに再インストールしないとクラッシュするようになった。
us.nobarriers.elsa,no working. why
us.nobarriers.elsa,awful I paid the yearly membership and it's giving me errors every sentence it's not worth it at all
us.nobarriers.elsa,this is very very good 👍😊
com.moymer.falou,super app
com.moymer.falou,this is helping so much with me being fluent in Korean
com.moymer.falou,Fantastic
com.moymer.falou,"subscription is very pricy, just started using the app so need more time to be convinced to purchase the subscription"
com.moymer.falou,جميل جدا والله بس مبيعلمكش أساسيات اللغة ك حرف ونطقها، بيدخل ع الموضوع ع طول ودي حاجه مش لطيفه، لكن جميل جدا ك محادثات وفيه مميزات كتير ممكن متلقهاش بره ف نزلة برضو هيكملك
com.moymer.falou,this is helping me practice Poland slowly and now I can talk Poland little bit
com.moymer.falou,nice
com.moymer.falou,"specifically searched for Luxembourgish, this can up and Luxembourgish is not an option"
com.moymer.falou,"Falou has been an amazing tool in my German learning journey. The app makes learning feel easy and natural, especially with its clear pronunciation guides and practical speaking exercises. I love how it allows me to practice real-life conversations, which has greatly improved my confidence and fluency over time. What really stands out is how user-friendly and engaging the app is. I can practice at my own pace, repeat lessons as often as I want, and instantly get feedback on my pronunciation."
com.moymer.falou,woooow
com.moymer.falou,it's my first lesson on it but it looks nice and beneficial app
com.moymer.falou,the best one
com.moymer.falou,microphone won't work
com.moymer.falou,good 👍 app
com.moymer.falou,"Day 4 I've had to drop a star, as it for some reason does not recognise my Pronunciation for Desu and Kudasai so far, and I have tried in other apps and my Japanese boss, and they say I am pronouncing it perfectly. So not sure why its bugging in the app. Day 1 so far so good. I like the flow and jumping straight into conversations. its only day 1 but I'm already preferring it to other apps I have. I will let you know if that changes. hopefully not, as it seems great so far."
com.moymer.falou,good
com.moymer.falou,it's so good
com.moymer.falou,it is very helpful for pronounce the word
com.moymer.falou,I love it❤️❤️❤️
com.moymer.falou,Thank u very much for this great app ☺️🙏🏾
com.moymer.falou,"unfortunately the translation is not correct, and they are also teaching it..."
com.moymer.falou,спасибо что каждый урок заставляете меня купить подписку. нет напоминание после каждого урока не будет помогать хотеть купить её это раздражает. отвратительно.
com.moymer.falou,"há APP é ótima, porém tem muitos anúncios, a cada lição você vê três á 4 anúncios 🤦🏾‍♂️, quer dizer, você não estuda de forma activa, tem sempre anúncios."
com.moymer.falou,excellent
com.moymer.falou,wow super
com.moymer.falou,"Really good! This app is one of the best apps to learn languages. In fact, better than Duolingo. It's helping my Bangladeshi mother to learn English to help talking with me and her friends at work. If I could, I would give 10 stars!"
com.moymer.falou,The speach recognition is horrible and it's literally shoving the paid version down your throat every chance it gets. Plus there's a time limit you can spend with the free version. Don't waste your time with this app unless you wanna spend money.
com.moymer.falou,Ads within 30 seconds is a no go
com.moymer.falou,worst app ever! after spending 2 minutes I got an offer for once to purchase without knowing the experience of the app. after declining it was 2 minutes learning and 1 minutes ads!!!
com.moymer.falou,very nice
com.hanum.jinjja,Anyeong
com.hanum.jinjja,ignore the bad review i left prior to this one i was being a dumbass
com.hanum.jinjja,"amazing app, clean interface, lessons are in the format of chatting with someone which makes learning quite exciting and immersive. i would say that it'd be even better if we could re-experience chatting when reviweing the previous lessons rather than just having an overview of the entire conversation if that makes sense. edit: thank you for the quick response! having both the option to re-experience the conversation and also the option to have an overview of the convo would be awesome!"
com.hanum.jinjja,Icl I acc don't like ts but I acc feel a bit bad. you get me? so 3 stars Innit?
com.hanum.jinjja,"Really great so far! I've lived in Korea for a couple years now but I still find it hard to learn Korean since my vocab is really weak. I've tried legit every app and this one has been the best. I'm actually able to remember things. I think I'm going to start paying for it because it's that good! I haven't tried anything other than vocab work but it's great so far. Would love if there was an option to turn off streak counts though, since I get a little discouraged when I log in late and lose it"
com.hanum.jinjja,this is an amazing learning Korean app
com.hanum.jinjja,"This is the most interactive and engaging language learning app I have ever tried! I usually never do any app purchases, but I'm seriously considering buying the lifetime access😆 i also absolutely like the new update that allows you to practice vocab on the side. I always find the examples sentences being ones that I would use in real life so they are indeed authentic. One thing that I'd like, though, is the possibility to go and review the past conversations to really solidify the content."
com.hanum.jinjja,"An app with promise and style. I'm still getting used to the app, but it's simplistic design has a way of keeping you wanting to interact with the app more. I'm more so focused on retaining more vocab before doing the AI chat. But I messed around with it and it's fun and useful. I hurriedly bought the lifetime at the current discount. As long as this app is maintained, I'll see myself continuing to use it in the future."
com.hanum.jinjja,really fun to learn how to communicate in Korean and how vocab terms are used!
com.hanum.jinjja,its fun and it really challenges you
com.unacademy.antonio,"genuinely great lessons. No annoying interruptions. Just chill learning with some great art to compliment the lesson. My new favorite language learning app. I do wish there was a dark mode! I usually only have time to study late in the day, and the bright white background can hurt my eyes a bit. other than that, no complaints!"
com.unacademy.antonio,Highly Recommend.
com.unacademy.antonio,i use a lot of language learning apps i really enjky the story board framework of this. its good for when im not ready to talk aloud
com.unacademy.antonio,idk what's up but this app makes me want to learn the language even more it makes learning actually fun
com.unacademy.antonio,"Duolingo is also ok but I needed something different, first day and it explains so well and now I can finally take my time and actually learn it not memorize"
com.unacademy.antonio,Its very hard to find tagalog language resources all in one place. thanks
com.unacademy.antonio,it's a good app for learning another language
com.unacademy.antonio,It helps a lot and you could also remember it perfect app to learn!
com.unacademy.antonio,THE BEST LANGUAGE APP EVER
com.unacademy.antonio,"Just words USEFUL,INGAGING,DEEP & INFORMATIVE"
com.unacademy.antonio,I never thought it could change my life this much honestly the best language learning app and yes even better than duolingo sadly but true 😢❤️❤️💗💗 RECOMENDED!!!
com.unacademy.antonio,"Wonderful for getting ahead in GCSE French! I wish there were more language options though, Irish Gaelic would be a lovely addition."
com.unacademy.antonio,honestly so far I enjoy this app more than the other apps I have used. I used to use Duolingo before and it was my favorite but this one doesn't have all the bright colors and it makes it easier for me to focus and remember the words and phrases I am learning.
com.unacademy.antonio,"love it, way better than Duolingo!💓💓💓💓💓💓"
com.unacademy.antonio,amazing app
com.unacademy.antonio,king of learning language
com.unacademy.antonio,"easy to use, lots of amazing features and easy to understand the definitions give. it's really helpful"
com.unacademy.antonio,"I like that it includes grammar lessons, it doesn't just tell you what the words are, but also how to use them!"
com.unacademy.antonio,perfect
com.unacademy.antonio,"Used it for a week so far and like it, but... Two things: new nouns should include the definite article to reinforce the word's gender. Second, the program is easy to navigate EXCEPT when you want to return to the main menu between lessons. The user is threatened with losing all of their XP if they exit to the main menu, even when the lesson is over. Like I said, I've only been at it for a week and I assume there will be more in-depth lessons on def articles later, but that's my observation now"
com.unacademy.antonio,great app for learning new language
com.unacademy.antonio,very perfect
com.unacademy.antonio,love it (˵¯͒〰¯͒˵)
com.unacademy.antonio,Best app for English learners
com.unacademy.antonio,Love it😍
com.unacademy.antonio,best of the best when it comes to language studies online
com.unacademy.antonio,very good
com.unacademy.antonio,"So, about the mic thing, it's the bestest best thing to have in a lesson, I enjoyed it a lot and it made me feel confident🥹🥹🥹🩷🩷🩷"
com.unacademy.antonio,"Got the premium version, but can't stop the lesson or you lose xp and have to restart.. Also. Can't jump lessons, so if you know a section you have to complete it to continue. Before there was a test for that. Made me lose interest."
com.unacademy.antonio,this app is the best for learning if u are looking something better than duolingo😁
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,A very wonderful app for learning French.
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,"outstanding way to learn french, very impressive"
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Never buy this app. They tie you to pay for it for 2 years without the right to resign. it's absolutely not worth it.
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,great app
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,very fun and interactive but I need to be able to see my friends score as well or talk to people online
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,This app makes learning French fun and understandable!
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,C'est bien
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,not sure
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,"для тех, кто замучился изучать французский, тема рабочая 😅👌"
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,100% pay to use 👎👎👎
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,An excellent text for jss
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,You gave no time to try?
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,"You really have to know at least some French just to navagate your way through the app. Serously, what's the point of that? Really disappointing. .....I'll pass"
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,I've learned so much from this than Duolingo
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,When it's le monde - it sure is high end
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Good
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,great
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Wirklich eine sehr interessante App. sie ist aber noch sehr unausgereift teilweise sehr chaotisch von der Handhabung das darf bei dem Preis nicht sein da muss investiert werden. der Preis ist dadurch nicht gerechtfertigt und schon fast eine Frechheit. ich bin mir allerdings sicher dass es ein sehr komplexes Produkt ist und schwer zu verwirklichen ist. Trotzdem hut ab an all die Beteiligten Lehrer die Lehrinhalte sind doch was besonderes sehr gut sogar. nur eben Haptik und Preis passen nicht.
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,"Not a bad French learning app, reading and writing is straightforward to get to grips with and also added help when needed. The only snag is the ending, when I get round to speaking is, there is no help to reply to conversations. How do I reply to the speaking audio?"
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Fraternité Liberté Égalité.. c'est la vie! Vive la France ❤️💜
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,j'aime apprendre le français avec les cours de Le Monde. it is highly recommend. thank you
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Didn't specify that's it's a paid app
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,They force you to sign up in order for you to use the app. You cannot see the learning content without signing up first.
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,good
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,"Why anyone would want to spend insane amounts of money on this I can't fathom. Doesn't let you progress as you like. At most one 10 minutes lesson per day. The lessons are not particularly engaging, as far as I can judge from the free testing."
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,The content is fun and interesting but the ui is poorly designed and the learning is not flexible at all. And finally its way overpriced. I really cant see how you can expect someone to pay 20 times the price of duolingo or six times the price of pimsleur. The price they ask is offensive to say the least.
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Worst app
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,it's super
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,Perfect app....i love it
fr.lemonde.ftqmobile,"Let me offer a helpful opinion, if I may. This app provides an engaging path to learning some modalities of French. But I think the design has parameters that are undesirable, to say nothing about price. Essentially, there is no option to advance faster than the lessons, so if you have trip planned in 3 months and you're motivated to learn, you'll be held back. If a foundational knowledge of French, you can't grow. At $1 each (with deals), it's expensive. And you can't cancel anytime."
com.david.android.languageswitch,"Too expensive. I was REALLY excited about this app because this is the best way for me to learn Spanish, but they only let you preview a few things before making you pay $44 for a year, or $4 a month. I'm really disappointed. 😔"
com.david.android.languageswitch,very useful
com.david.android.languageswitch,Looks like it has potential. Unfortunately they do not offer a proficiency test to match your current skill to their content. This leaves you casting about wondering what level you should be on. They don't offer a trial period so you won't have the opportunity to try it first. Looks like AI generated content which means that it may contain inaccurate expressions of the language that an actual speaker may sense to be incorrect.
com.david.android.languageswitch,AI slop app
com.david.android.languageswitch,really useful for learning languages!
com.david.android.languageswitch,"It is such an immersive App that helps with learning french, reading and understanding the use of words in normal settings and daily conversations. Highly recommended👍🏾"
com.david.android.languageswitch,Its amazing
com.david.android.languageswitch,"I hated it, I payed for the yearly premium version cuz I wanted to invest in my goal of the year (improving my japanese A1 to B1), but the learning dynamics are awful, as I English teacher I would never use this kind of structure to teach a language, I regret the money I spent"
com.david.android.languageswitch,يظهر انه يدعم اللغة العربية ولكن الكلمات تظهر كحروف منفصلة ومتداخلة
com.david.android.languageswitch,"Requested a refund within 24 hours and within the 14-day policy. Google Play declined and I contacted support directly, but haven’t received any response for several days."
com.david.android.languageswitch,I just started but I find it quite enjoyable. I didn't realize how much Spanish I really knew. Having both the Spanish and English stories on the screen at the same time helps me fill in the blanks. Being able to add words to my vocabulary list is great as well!
com.david.android.languageswitch,"The interface is terribly designed, when you repeat words for study, if you know a word and immediately mark it as remembered, you won't be able to listen to the next one. I bought a subscription for a year and couldn't imagine what I could download. The app is not ready in the Play Store. The texts are very strange, most likely written by AI.Can I get a refund for my subscription? I am not satisfied with the app."
com.david.android.languageswitch,"Got Premium, yet your A1 Arabic content doesn't have vowels (I am aware it's dropped later on)"
com.david.android.languageswitch,ganz gut
com.david.android.languageswitch,I wish this app also had Persian language support.
com.david.android.languageswitch,good method to learn fast and also keep updated about latest happenings in and around you.
com.david.android.languageswitch,Great way to learn. I'm really loving this app. I'm improving my French whilst learning about the culture and I'm an adult way.
com.david.android.languageswitch,l really liked it soo much it helps a lot.
com.david.android.languageswitch,"Clearly just AI generated. The text has grammatical errors and doesn't flow like a human person's writing. The voices are just plain and with no emotions. I don't see why anyone should pay for this. The paywall appears immediately, and based on the quality of the free content, it really should not have a paywall at all until the creators work out the kinks."
com.david.android.languageswitch,I subscribed up to learn Portuguese from my native Ukrainian. But it's completely AI translation which is really bad. It's impossible to learn a language when there are so many mistakes in the translation of a language learning app!
com.david.android.languageswitch,"So typical of Google Play store AND these app companies not being transparent IN THE BEGINNING that this app is not free but rather fee based. Additionally, they have you download their app, asks you questions about your interests and why you want to learn a new language, THEN DROP THE SUBSCRIPTION RATES ON YOU! That is not honest and not ethical conning people like this. Tell people upfront about fees BEFORE leading them on. You'll find they will appreciate this more."
com.david.android.languageswitch,"Not what it once was. I used to love this app, but recently, translations have more and more errors, and pronunciation is hit or miss. Many of the translations read/sound like they are AI generated/voiced, rather than made by native speakers, which I think is the source of many errors. It's still a great concept, and I give it a star for the news story feature, but the app is definitely not worth a subscription anymore."
com.david.android.languageswitch,it's ok
com.david.android.languageswitch,Very useful as an additional app for language study.
com.david.android.languageswitch,Good App. 👍
com.david.android.languageswitch,Enjoying reading stories in Spanish.
com.david.android.languageswitch,"while I am reading, I get pop up screens telling me I've almost reached my goal. I also get these screens when I try to replay the story. I have to close the screens 4 or 5 times because they keep coming back. it is really annoying. also...the beginner stories are too difficult. I cannot do the ""course"" because it requires you to answer questions before you can move on. the dictionary is very slow. I do this on my phone and keep my tablet handy with another translation app."
com.david.android.languageswitch,for the price its estubenda lots of historias para leer . if your serious about learning give it a try.
com.david.android.languageswitch,Sehr gute
com.david.android.languageswitch,"The stories provide an avenue for listening immersion, contextual leaning over brute memorisation. Highly recommend!!!"
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,really laggy
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,good
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,it's nice but I don't have money for premium sooo
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,عالی و ساده
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,thank you
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"Great for learning languages at your own pace! I love how fun it is and how it's so interactive. I would've gave this 5 stars, but the only negative comments I have is that there isn't many options for categories upon first opening the app, and that it doesn't clearly teach you the words, the only way I can describe it is as a study and test system, which can be useful for memorizing words, but not so much learning new things as effectively as you could be."
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"really good app for beginners, no gimmicks, just repetition repetition repetition. it works."
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,really good foundations
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,good boy.......
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,it easy to learn for beginners
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,I am now in the France and I am a indian
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,it mostly teaches you mostly how to spell and write it so I'll recommend it to people learning how to spell. But it's really good!
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,perfect for beginners
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,This is very good
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,appreciate
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,It cannot offline anymore.
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,very good
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"Good app, better than Duolingo in my opinion. Is very direct in teaching the language rather than trying to make you spend more time on the app."
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,Please add Khmer to this French learning app. Thank you. Good luck. I like this app.
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,is very easy app to learn french
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,i love this educational tools for learning French language but I have Aphasia so I need to repeat and know if I already understand it.
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"Pratico, intuitivo, non necessariamente a pagamento consente di studiare e testare ciò che si è appreso"
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,"je aime cette app je aprende beaucoup, je remercie. i only gave 4 because I downloaded recently and then I'm using only now"
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,good
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,Very nice for beginners
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,I like the audios but can't open anything else except the first four lessons
com.breboucas.francesparaviajar,good

com.masterenglishprogram,"Waste your time answering a questionnaire for 10 minutes only to find out at the end that you have to pay R$80 per month blindly because you can't test the program beforehand. This is by far the worst way to convince someone to buy your product. It's tedious, it's expensive, and it doesn't seem trustworthy. The way the copy induces you to buy the product is similar to any scam website that sells cheap, useless courses."
com.masterenglishprogram,It's the better App
com.masterenglishprogram,it's ok
com.masterenglishprogram,"pague la aplicación para mi primer mes de uso, descargue la aplicación y nunca pude iniciar ya que nunca pasó del paso de contraseña y no hay correo para solicitar el reembolso o para que vean porque no me permite pasar de esa opción, tengo días de estar intentando pasar de ese paso y no se puede 😡"

com.simyasolutions.ling.ja,"An interesting app, but lots of mistakes inside, the voice doesn't match the reading, or the romanji is wrong and doesn't match the Kanji and hiragana or katakana.

com.hellochinese,good app
com.hellochinese,"The best language learning experience I've had - I'm 8 days in and feel like I'm actually retaining the information. The v2 lesson plans are highly organised and compact, covering everything from the basics to conversational in just under two weeks, and with time and practice I'm sure it will come fluently. will update this review accordingly in the future."

com.hellochinese,it's amazing
com.hellochinese,Great apps so far
com.hellochinese,pleasant experience so far. UI is modern and I like the fact is based on HSK curriculum which has rigor to it
com.hellochinese,"Before I begin my journey into learning Chinese I did my homework. I tried tons of different apps for days, asked in reddit discord and even AI. They all point to this app. So far I enjoy it. It's just too bad it only went up to HSK 2? And they removed lifetime sub option back then. But for beginners this is more than enough."

com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,i love it
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,I absolutely LOVE iHeart streaming platform. I use it daily and most especially to go to sleep as I suffer from severe insomnia. I am in love with being able to find piano music for the last several months. When that no longer works I search and find something else that will work as my options are endless.
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,sweet
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,I love the variety of music and podcast on iHeart
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,"You don't have to pay for this to enjoy it. screw storage. you don't need that. don't pay for this. it's not worth it. if you don't want to listen to ads, just turn the app off and back on. it's that easy. I have had the free version for over a year and I haven't listened to one ad in over a year LOL. you just got to fight back and not allow them to control you. that's all you got to do"
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,Nice way to just relax and listen to what you want instead of the trash stations you can pick exactly what your in the mood for two thumbs up guys.
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,so far so good I was using spotify and it seemed to be draining my Bluetooth speakers a lot. I don't understand that? also I think the signal is cleaner on iHeartRadio
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,"After two songs play when live streaming a radio station, I get 2 hours of ads instead of music. This is app is no longer enjoyable and I would not recommend it to anyone."
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,"app stopped working. I opened the spp to listen to the morning radio show and it will not open the station, it will not search, it will not do anything, yet it is asking for all kinds of new permissions. no thank you. deleted app"
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,Easy to navigate. Great sound. Ability to listen to radio stations from around the U.S. And the rest of the world.
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,"if your app starts blasting audio the second I open it, that's a 1 star and an app deletion for me dawg. fix it and I might be back"
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,Love all the different stations and they are all free!!! Excellent service!! 😀
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,having a typical time to open app
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,iheart is better than Sirius XM. Not contrived. Never gimmicky. Simply everything you could want for your listening pleasure.
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,"THANK YOU, FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO FOR US LISTENERS ❤️"
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,Missing basic accessibility features; but certainly isn't missing ads.
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,trying to listen to a singers playlist BUT IT KEEPS PLAYING OTHER SONGS MADE BY OTHER PEOPLE
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,Good overall. It would be nice to have more stations which appeal to me.
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,great app!
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,Not sure what changed but over the past week it keeps dropping or not even starting as if it is loading?
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,it works excellent at home in NY or on vacation in Punta Cana on the beach. Only complaint is the country stations play way too much Jelly Roll. I like him but not every hr. Best part is it's free!!!!!!
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,love the app
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,there's too much other music in with my playlist.
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,"for my use its fine - the music audio is excellent (I'm in Detroit and I want ckww 580 am and 89x now that it's alternative again). Iheart is a tad glitchy but I can live with it once I get it under control. CKWW is outstanding- (former cklw ""the big 8!) definitely the music I grew up with. I love and respect Canada 🇨🇦 btw. So glad the broadcast difficulties between the U.S. and Canada seem to have been resolved? 😬 oops dont want to jinx it."
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,I love it
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,"no, I will not sign in."
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,Overall I love the app! Has a great selection of podcast and radio stations. I love listening to the Unashamed podcast while I'm working! The only issue I have had is while I'm listening in my background it will randomly cut off and close itself out. If I am on the app doing nothing else I don't have this problem.
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,love it
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,Great! I Love It!
com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,Great podcasts

ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,very good app. but advertisement is so many.
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,Great app
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,I did not they were charging me.
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"Used Grammarly for years. The extension used to be one of the most useful tools for writing emails etc. Now it's probably the worst option in its category for writing while also being easily the most expensive and least feature rich. To top it all off, they absolutely bury the unsubscribe button beneath all of your invoices. Cancel subscription doesn't even appear as an option on a mobile browser unless you scroll to the very bottom of the invoice list. Feels scummy and really disappointing."
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,good
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,An awesome app for those people who want to receive support at different levels of grammar and writing difficulties. I am happy with all the services.
ai.metaverselabs.grammargpt,"I have attempted to contact customer service on two occasions because there is no sound and no vibration from the keyboard, and all I ever get is the answer that they're not available, and they will get back to me.

com.englishtest,"At first I found the app in the play store for studying in English to improve my skill. This app helps me to improve 4 skills like listening. And I often study English on the app . I remember since I found this app, its name is the English Test. Suddenly the app name is changed and the practice test can't be used. I feel so sad."

com.quizlet.quizletandroid,the app is slow. Disappointing because it was recommended to me and no it's not my phone that's the problem. it's most definitely the map
com.quizlet.quizletandroid,very bad
com.quizlet.quizletandroid,great learning tool
com.quizlet.quizletandroid,this app is fantastic. it makes learning fun and easy. it has various usefull functions like tests and learing which really help me out but there is just this one thing. its the subscription its too expensive for me I can't afford 3000 rupees right now or choose 700 rupees per month its too much for me😭😭. and since there is limited amount of free uses i don't think I will be able to use it. although its really good app i would recommend it too yall if u got money 👍👍.

com.quizlet.quizletandroid,"The app is incredible for flashcards, however literally everything else is behind a paywall. If I want to quiz myself by taking a test I have to pay for it. One of the best ways to learn on the app is the learn feature and it is also behind a pay wall. That aspect I can understand abit why you pay for it because it is so nice, but I'm not a fan of the pay wall at all, and the test feature is something I wish wasn't behind the paywall."
com.quizlet.quizletandroid,it makes studying easy and does not have ads.
com.quizlet.quizletandroid,perfect for revising
com.quizlet.quizletandroid,unusable if you don't subscribe. I redownloaded it after using it for the last time in 2019 in high school. The amount of ads and pushing for a subscription is insane. I can't learn 10 cards without watching an unskippable ad

com.hellotalk.hellojapanese,"sebenarnya ini aplikasi yang bagus tapi sayang, sepertinya masih ada yang perlu diperbaiki fitur suara tidak berganti, begitu pula dengan tingkat kesulitannya saat baru download tingkat kesulitannya N2 lalu saya berganti ke N5 tapi tidak berganti tolong di bantu"
com.hellotalk.hellojapanese,"honestly the app isn't bad ,but it's not beginner friendly as a total beginner would be confused as from where to start from if you could structure it in a way like ""a beginner"" ,""an intermediate"" and ""an advanced section"" with exercises after each lesson and challenges after each section. i think it could be better."
com.hellotalk.hellojapanese,it will be better if this app includes all languages for translation purposes. 😢
com.hellotalk.hellojapanese,"unfortunately, I don't have money to pay subscriptions 🙂. sayonara"

com.appalex.learnlanguages,Wonderful application. This is what I was looking for!! Thank you Wordy.
com.appalex.learnlanguages,"eu amo esse aplicativo, uso todos os dias para italiano/inglês, porém uma coisa que poderia melhorar é o ""modo prática"" depois de assistir um vídeo (tem muitos erros na hora das perguntas) e as letras das legendas sejam mais legíveis ou até maiores, pois fica quase impossível ler enquanto assiste uma palavra nova que está quase invisível no azul forte da fonte (uso o modo escuro) além de não ter o suporte de ficar na horizontal! De resto, um app muito bom mas que pode melhorar!"

com.appalex.learnlanguages,"Remek ötlet, rossz megvalósítás! Rengeteg probléma van az alkalmazással kezdve azzal hogy sok esetben nem jól fordít, kifejezéseket a legtöbb esetben nem sikerül lefordítania. Ha netflix es műsort szeretnél nézni külön kell kapcsolgatni a feliratot, mert szikronba nem lehet a felirattal hozni vagy olykor nem is az a felirat megtalálható a Wordy-ben! A szavak gyakorlása is nagyon gyenge megvalósítás, mert a megtanult szavakat csak megnézni lehet és felolvastatni, fordítást megnézni már nem."

co.app.langeek,😏😏
co.app.langeek,an amazing app
co.app.langeek,It's too expensive for English only.
co.app.langeek,amazing
co.app.langeek,Amazing apps
co.app.langeek,Great app to learn english!
co.app.langeek,"It’s a really interesting and useful app. I feel comfortable using it, especially since it provides an image for each word. However, I’ve run into a problem: the section for accessing my word list doesn’t open, and support hasn’t given me any response about this issue."
co.app.langeek,"I'm on cloud nine to finding this app, it includes a lot of vocabularies that are super useful and comes in handy in the exam .The most important thing you can find the words English vs English plus with your native language if you want, that's cool 👍✨"
com.jernung.infinite.fra,you should add the words with articles
com.jernung.infinite.fra,A joke.
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"Over all I enjoy the Infinite Language Apps, but I was surprised to see the word for ""pig"" taught as ""porc"" (pork) rather than ""cochon"" (pig). Are the word lists checked by native French speakers? Makes me wonder if the other words are accurate. I sure hope so."
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"This app is very helpful, I love it very easy to use and helps alot to practice french for me. Love it!"
com.jernung.infinite.fra,it's perfect
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Good but you can't really do anything unless you pay to unlock. Duolingo is better.
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"Oh, is it in ""beta""? No matter… it's Super Cool about buying it allows some more difficulty settings, but what I was hoping for; was to have some new words to try out… maybe even some phrases or something…? Anything, really. But, at least; the groundwork is pretty awesome as-is. …and if it actually really is in ""beta""? Then I certainly look forward to the finish of this very cool language-teaching game already!! 😊"
com.jernung.infinite.fra,it is fun to play and helps me now
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"enjoy all languages set with same words in same process, so good in linguistics observation."
com.jernung.infinite.fra,👍
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Freezes on launch. Help
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Amazing apps fr help u learn so fast 😍😍❤️
com.jernung.infinite.fra,very basic learning is free the rest is paid
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"not good,Duolingo is the best"
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"finally found a language game that's visual, cheap, doesn't require a monthly subscription. the visually based learning is a huge plus!!"
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Need more words
com.jernung.infinite.fra,best
com.jernung.infinite.fra,★⚪★★⚪★ nOOooOOOO why 2O in the f wor rD edit THANSK FOR THE LIKES
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Fantastic app. Great for drilling French basics. Would love to see the alphabet and more vocabulary added. Would also be happy to pay for those upgrades. Thanks!
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"It's extremely basic French, no masculine and feminine pronouns so it won't help you string sentences together. However, for what it's meant to be, it's a good app. Great for visualising and building a foundation of beginner words. If you're past the basics, this app isn't for you. But it was fun to play through!"
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Pretty good for beginners getting their fundamental vocabulary
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"J'amie cette application , facil et amusante ."
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Reasonably productive to teach multiple languages at one time. It Infinite has 10 language games teaching same words in same process and expands brain and individuals ability to learn. Multiple uses for this process of learning. No concern of age and the words can corrilate with other games and learning materials.
com.jernung.infinite.fra,it's so good and enjoy
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Mong ra nhiều từ vựng hơn
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Best way to learn French. It's very fun and entertaining
com.jernung.infinite.fra,love it
com.jernung.infinite.fra,Easy and fun!
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"Should really include articles with the words as it is really important to know the gender of the words to correctly write adjectives describing the nouns, other parts of speech and whole sentences later. To ignore it leaves out a lot of important information."
com.jernung.infinite.fra,"A nice fresh idea. It needs to have the articles/gender of words both on the word list, and also when the comets are falling."

tunein.player,So much to choose from and easy to use
tunein.player,Can not figure out why TuneIn will not open!!!!
tunein.player,cool
tunein.player,many great international radio including Taiwan. hoping they can add more Taiwan radio stations
tunein.player,it's important thing the quality of transmitting quality of sound I would like you to create the same quality of sound for all stations not only Florida cool jazz.
tunein.player,"No previous/next favorite station button , so useless for driving"
tunein.player,"one of the slowest apps I've used, but good music"
tunein.player,"Absolute No.1 Radio App past, present and Future Period."
tunein.player,The one with less add
tunein.player,Not as many ads as the more popular one if radio-style is just what you need.
tunein.player,dire. search results are just more adverts
tunein.player,Long time user of basic(free) but lately the app will play ads for minutes on end and then it tells me that there's a connection error. Rebooted and no improvement. So much for updates and improvements. Will see what happens when I use it shortly. Used to be dependable.
tunein.player,It's the best 👌
tunein.player,I greatly enjoy the ability to tune in to the Sarah Applebee's Show in the UK on Hailsham FM...thanks.
tunein.player,"yep, I'm done. not only have the ads become overwhelmingly intrusive and annoying, the app crashes after every one of their ads now and I have to restart which then makes me have to listen to that group of ads at the beginning all over again. this app is totally, trash. It now interrupts mid song and plays commercials. This is ridiculous. I have no issue with ads, but mid song? Really?"
tunein.player,it great!
tunein.player,Great selection love it
tunein.player,"Missing some main stream stations, but still a good radio app. just upgraded phone, app stops playing constantly, opens random malware websites, ??? down to 2 stars, from 4."
tunein.player,ok
tunein.player,"Too many nasty ads, I hate when things start free and then start charging as a you tuber said. You can listen to almost any station directly without the need of any app for FREE AND NO ADS."
tunein.player,good
tunein.player,"it works well on Wi-Fi and 5g cellular, but stops working on 4g cellular."
tunein.player,ads keep restart when clicking skip and streams don't load
tunein.player,fantastic app for any music taste
tunein.player,wonderful
tunein.player,3 ads each time you change the station sometimes the same Netflix garbage ad 3 times over just to start streaming a Radio station that then plays it's own ads 😂😂 no thanks
tunein.player,Love the app when it's not buffering! lol
tunein.player,useful
tunein.player,"ADS, ADS, ADS, not only that but they're WAY louder than the actual stuff your listening too. listening to something on low volume and then BAM loud ads"
tunein.player,"way too many ads. If you stop or take for whatever reason. you have to watch a video ad, then another. just been through 6 ads in 10 mins, due to taking a call."

com.db.lingotv,"I was instantly hooked on this app after trying it, my Japanese became so much smoother and more confident. But the app doesn't really work. I got the voice recognition to pick up my voice once... And then it never worked again. Restarted app, phone, and reinstalled. Nothing worked :( sad I have to delete, I was thinking of buying a yearly plan."
com.db.lingotv,Nice
com.db.lingotv,good app
com.db.lingotv,"This app is super useful with its amazing and outstanding Aoi AI tutor. Compare to other AI tutor, it stands out. As an N3-level learner, I think it's the best learning tool I've ever used."
com.db.lingotv,Good app. But could you help me to recover my password? I forgot password and don't know how to re-inlog again
com.db.lingotv,Like
com.db.lingotv,Amazing but I wish there were no money spending included 😔
com.db.lingotv,Horrible
com.db.lingotv,"This app is not working well at all. I can't hear the other person, or the conversation lags. It has only been a couple days. Can I get a refund?"
com.db.lingotv,I can not reset my practice of my account. I want to practice repeat and repeat.How to restart practice in my account.
com.db.lingotv,very good
com.db.lingotv,a good one Aoi but my Japanese speaking is not perfect but soo nice talking to her🤫 わたしはすきです
com.db.lingotv,"Vraiment super concept. Beaucoup plus de scénario/situations disponibles que je pensais et plusieurs autres modes disponibles. Par contre, après que la première conversation avec l'IA soit finie, on ne peut plus continuer sans payer, même le lendemain. C'est dommage, il faudrait laisser le choix à ceux qui peuvent payer de payer pour continuer à utiliser l'appli et ceux qui ne peuvent pas, d'attendre le lendemain. Du coup, je désinstalle."
com.db.lingotv,Wonderful app
com.db.lingotv,this app is crazy 🔥
com.db.lingotv,ずれはエピピ良いし わたしはすきです。
com.db.lingotv,"Je suis allée voir cette application juste pour essayer, et j'ai été vraiment convaincue par l'échange en japonais que j'ai pu avoir avec l'IA Aoi. Je vais tester à plusieurs reprises encore, avant de passer à la version payante. En tous cas, cette app. peut être une solution pour des apprenants qui bloquent sur l'oral en japonais, ce qui est très fréquent."
com.db.lingotv,"Can't find any next bottom in the ""choose at lest 3 "" Idk Developer please fix it I need this app so much"
com.db.lingotv,I'm actually a huge fan of this app
com.db.lingotv,"Extremely buggy for such a pricy subscription. The app stops recognising the voice in the middle of practice until I restart it. Sometimes it's just the users's pich accent line that disappeares. The AI is not tuned to teach grammar or define words with example sentences and other features. All in all , great Idea but poor implementation . Btw, lessons results are always in Chinese."
com.db.lingotv,Voice recognition works very badly after recent update. Please fix it asap!
com.db.lingotv,"Actually pretty good, rather a bit expensive it seems, I think there can be more to improve, not having AI pictures or just any picture in general or be able to pick a picture would be less awkward. It has very nice suggestions, it would be nice if there was a toggle for furigana for Kanji or for certain Kanji past certain levels for the ones the user doesn't know yet. The UI can be a little better too, needs some work and some dark mode would be nice."
com.db.lingotv,The app itself is really good and helpful when it actually opens so the reason it is only 3 stars is for the fact it won't open so and I have good wifi and it won't open I have let it load for the past 20 minutes and it hasn't loaded and I tried restarting the app and it still won't work so it is currently redownloading I will change my rating if this issue becomes resolved. Thank you!
com.db.lingotv,This app really help me learning jpn language and improving my speaking skill except for the chat power that ran out before I knew it.
com.db.lingotv,"I can't even sign into the app, at the second step it just stops"
com.db.lingotv,There is a sound of pronunciation Formal and informal conversations in various places Very great
com.db.lingotv,ok
com.db.lingotv,A very good learning tool that teaches pronunciation and pitch very cleverly. Also the vocabulary used is functional and useful for tasks that learners will need to know on a daily basis. Overall very impressive.

ru.poas.frenchwords,lots of info; pronunciation and vocab
ru.poas.frenchwords,"Awesome app! I started to study French words and I really like it! the premium version is super affordable and it's worth it! I love the option to add your own pictures for each and every word - that's genius! (a message to the developers - Please please make Traditional Chinese characters version! I'm studying Chinese as well and wanted to purchase Chinese, but there is only Simplified version.)"
ru.poas.frenchwords,When you start it gives three options to pay for it with no free option so I think I may have bren charged money for it. It keeps going into a blue screen almost like a full page ad that you have to keep closing . So annoying I quit the app before learning 1 word and uninstalled it. What kind of a moron thought that was a good idea? Grade = F.
ru.poas.frenchwords,"good for revising words that you're likely to forget because of lack of practice. can also add your own vocabulary, although dictionary doesn't always have the words you search for."
ru.poas.frenchwords,"This is incredibly useful, probably at pretty much all levels of French learning, I feel. I like all the functions and options. It is simple to use, not a lot of bells and whistles, which suits me perfectly. I get quite a buzz from vocab learning, especially when I'm reading a book or watching a video and I recognise a word I've learnt... a word which probably seemed pretty random at the time! I really recommend this one, as it has definitely furthered my French learning. No negatives either."
ru.poas.frenchwords,Great app. Must more words now. Need words MORE NOW MUST! GIVE ALL WORDS NOW.
ru.poas.frenchwords,I love it ♥️
ru.poas.frenchwords,Best flash card app for vocab. Easy to use. Way more user friendly than anki
ru.poas.frenchwords,I started with the gaming style of language learning apps but I now like this one so much better than those gaming language apps. It's rewarding enough just to feel like I'm learning.
ru.poas.frenchwords,"quite decent actually, this is my first time using the concept of flashcards and it's been pretty helpful since then, but I can definitely see a room for improvement in this app so never stop optimizing développeurs!"
ru.poas.frenchwords,It's OK. The thing I don't like it's that not every word has examples below
ru.poas.frenchwords,"gave it 5 stars, but now pronunciation doesn't work on example sentences."
ru.poas.frenchwords,simple. easy. perfect !
ru.poas.frenchwords,"Great app, but I can't keep my lifetime subscription when I move from one phone to another, I don't want to pay again to get the subscription on my new phone"

ru.poas.frenchwords,parfait app.
ru.poas.frenchwords,good experience so far 😄
ru.poas.frenchwords,great app!!! thank you
ru.poas.frenchwords,"I have been using this app for over a year now. Honestly, if you are learning French, I could not reccomended this app enough as one of the tools you use to master the language. I will do the 5 words a day, then review for 10 minutes daily. This, mixed with other ways of getting exposure and practice really work. All that, and you can do it for free on this app. Well worth it"
ru.poas.frenchwords,Awesome
ru.poas.frenchwords,"It's pretty good and definitely what I've been looking for. What would make it better is more information for words, like showing if it is an adjective or a noun, and examples using words in a sentence, which is done for some words and would be helpful if it were used for more."
ru.poas.frenchwords,AMAZING 👏👏👏 IT HELPED SO MUCH 😀
ru.poas.frenchwords,"It's an excellent app, it's helping me to learn french"
ru.poas.frenchwords,I love this app it is actually fantastic 💯💯💯

com.sirius,Scammy business model. terrible glitchy app. stops casting every few minutes and blaring from my phone. awful.
com.sirius,"I have sirus for my vehicle and it's amazing. The app for the phone is trash, I have good internet and it keeps refreshing. if I knew that it would perform this way I would've went with the lesser package not impressed by the app at all... if I could give it 0 stars I would"
com.sirius,"Want to Pretend It is 1995? Try canceling this garbage app. first of all its janky as hell, content stinks and the cancellation process had to go though 2 different agents before it let me cancel. It is like being back in the stone ages. try to cancel and be prepared for the most infuriating experience of your life. I will never give these people my payment info ever. REPLY: NO! that option redirected me to how to cancel: phone/chat. there is NO WAY TO AUTO CANCEL + 5 DAYS FOR CONF EMAIL. BS"
com.sirius,great
com.sirius,"Radio station all over the world, you hear your favourite singer, rapper, country singer anything or anyone that you like this app is here for you."
com.sirius,"terrible app.... songs quit playing. you have to close the app and restart. if that's not bad enough, even after you close the app....it starts up own its own. would not recommend this app to anyone.....Hello I heart radio ????"
com.sirius,"Terrible, you guys have a 7 billion a year operating budget and can't make an app that plays longer then 5-10 minutes."
com.sirius,Nice very good
com.sirius,This app overrides other apps!
com.sirius,well worth the subscription 👍🏼
com.sirius,Doesn't take login. Tried resettong it twice... very frustrating will just use radio only I guess.
com.sirius,app generally works well. I listen to octane more than any other channel. quit playing interviews over music. leave those to the app channels not live
com.sirius,"Love this app, only complaint is I will here the same songs several times or a song comes on from a different genre. Definitely a great app and I do appreciate hearing my favorites just want to hear some more come threw occasionally. love the no adds and the go back feature!"
com.sirius,it's ok
com.sirius,last update was terrible. when listening to an artist station it will play the song and then at the end it will back up and play the last 30 seconds again for no reason. to access my saved stations takes 4 steps to get through. not good while driving. when skipping ahead a song it will now skip 2 songs. when I hit skip forward on my controls it now changes the station. I dont know what you guys with this last update but I may cancel my subscription.
com.sirius,"I HATE THIS APP ... I only have it for The Bonfire 🔥 Two taps is a 10 second skip forward. Period. You absolute drips! Big Jay Oakerson and Bobby Kelly are the only reason you get money from me for years. For the love of... make the app function like any other sound player, it drives me crazy to try to skip and I end up in some arbitrary new ""chapter"" of the show that you made up. The design is absolutely idiotic and you probably have to over engineer just to do this. Your designer is a 🤡"
com.sirius,"I am extremely disappointed that the updated Sirius App did not work on my Android phone, Galaxy Samsung . I woke up on Jan/15th, listening to station 126 & by 11:00 that morning ,the App read Disabled. What happened ? I still don't know 7 hrs later. The AI had me get rid of the APP,& then connected me to a live Tech. He indicated I could NOT use the updated Sirius APP on my cellphone, but I could stream on my laptop! This is not fair for I carry my cell phone everywhere but my laptop never!"
com.sirius,"Needs work. Issues with playback, random track/episode skipping, poor integration with Android auto."
com.sirius,"This app keeps messing up.It keeps cutting out.It doesn't matter where i'm at.This app is not like what it used to be.It needs to be fixed or dismantled.One of the two, it's not worth the money that I pay to get some good music.And it always cuts out"
com.sirius,like It
com.sirius,kindly screw off. I don't want your free trial with my car. Stop sending me mail bugging me about it.
com.sirius,Love ❤️ it
com.sirius,love Sirius! you can find pretty much any artist or style of music save it in your library and have it available when you want it.
com.sirius,Have been a fan of SiriusXM's total domination of the internet radio business for many years now. And them having my radio to-go is spot on with my schedule. Love having the Onyx radio in my world as well as the app. I plan to stick with my XM for many more years. Keep doing a great job guys and gals of XM.
com.sirius,love hearing classic country
com.sirius,"Downloaded this app a year ago and only sporadic issues that were minor. Now as of 1/14/2026, the app is starting to cut off while listening to music and sometimes has stopped playing a podcast clip and skipped to the next clip. I also have this in my car so I expect the developers to have a smoothe running app to listen to channels only offered through the app. Please fix."
com.sirius,"can't find dr. greg carr and lamont king show on sirius xm urban view 7am show or for it to replay today Jan 14, 2026"

org.coursera.android,"Coursera is an excellent learning platform that provides high-quality courses from top universities and industry experts. The course structure is well-organized, and the explanations are clear and easy to understand. Assignments and quizzes help in practical learning, and the certificates add value to career growth. Overall, Coursera is very useful for students and professionals who want to improve their skills at their own pace."
org.coursera.android,"i feel like been scammed by coursera. i just enrolled for trial but already been charged. already cancel the subscription but the charge still ongoing. when report, cannot detect. nonsense. now, the course cannot be access anymore and the money also gone. i paid rm159.99 just only for a few days trial. oh my god."
org.coursera.android,"I see you only focuse on business, development and IT and AI and all computer related jobs. you never focuse of Teaching careers or other human careers. make other human courses and make a guide how to take a high paying jobs."
org.coursera.android,coursera is a great way to learn. the question on the quiz did not always seem to match the videos. the customer support replied quickly but did not read my email. my name was entered in incorrectly and I told them the verify ID feature said it was verified so this has not been resolved.
org.coursera.android,food for the brain.
org.coursera.android,"coursera gives me the opportunity to gain skills or take classes without having to leave my house. I pay for the pro option, I definitely recommend it. they say knowledge is power. i enjoy learning more either the use of Coursera bc they make it easy and its not boring. I find myself using the app everyday. ive learned so much in a short period of time, mostly things I thot i had no interest in learning but gave a chance anyways and found them to be very useful."
org.coursera.android,"Tried to get financial support to do the courses, to become a better more knowledgeable person but this thing took me in circles, you'd think for such an outlandishly wealthy company they'd have nouse about them, if you're so loaded why charge so much? If there's a financial support section why is it so hard to get to? Why are there so many reviews stating refunds are non existent? The people who set this up are out of touch, greedy, self centered humans who don't want people like me to do well."
org.coursera.android,"Good morning, please I have a problem on cleaning data with spreadsheets on the Google data analytics certificate,I have accessed the file I mean the Data spreadsheet for cleaning (XLSX File) that was on the practice assignment,my problem is that after clicking on the Data tab on my own spreadsheet,I can't see create a filter option in my own spreadsheet 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔"
org.coursera.android,"I was charged $39 again after already paying for and completing the Google IT course. The second charge happened automatically, and when I contacted support within the same hour, I was told that no refund would be issued. There was no clear warning that finishing the course would still result in another charge, and refusing a refund for an immediate, unwanted payment feels unfair and misleading. Be careful: even after you finish the course, charges may continue, and customer support won't refund"
org.coursera.android,"enrollment is based on months, and most of the time on site it shows error 403 when trying to open and resolves almost after 24 hours. so if you have a deadline or last days of completing the course, you'll be unable to complete on time therefore there is no certificate provided. If you want a certificate, you have to again enroll in the course"
org.coursera.android,"I am really disappointed by this app as I paid 1,699 amount for ""Google people management essential"" course and it's not giving me all courses and asked me to pay for further module of this like other course of the module of the same course google management essential have 2hrs and asking to pay and i couldn't even submit my challenge and couldn't access to graded its asking to pay like Whyy when I enrolled in this course in should have got all the course of 8hrs right but I only got of 1hrs"
org.coursera.android,በጣም አስደሳች አፕ ነው የተለያየ አፖች የስጠቅማል ነገር ግን አንዳን ጊዜ ያስቸግራል አሁን የተስተካከለ ይመስለኛል
org.coursera.android,Not useful for me.
org.coursera.android,I took a full course that said they offered a certificate and at end of the course I couldn't download or buy it. I had talk to their Ai with terrible help and finally had to find a way to speak to someone and they told me the 13hr course doesn't offer any completion status. This was with a subscription. Terrible service and false advertising.
org.coursera.android,"Offline download is kind of useless when we need connection when playing the video for the course to sync + it keeps using full mobile data to ""stream"" the video. Please fix. Thanks."
org.coursera.android,"I appreciate that, and I really recommend."
org.coursera.android,"it used to be go, but after update, I can't login to the app, just view / explore course catalog only"
org.coursera.android,The best Online course platform where u can explore and gain valuable knowledge. The instructors are also very professional. I am just falling in love with the data.
org.coursera.android,good luck 🤞
org.coursera.android,I have Purchased Coursera Plus Subscription for 2450 INR. But for Introduction to Hospitality Revenue Management. Module 2 and Module 3 While Unlock full access. I am not able to view the content. I am not happy with you. There is no proper response from the team.
org.coursera.android,Great application
org.coursera.android,Coursera is an online education company who is looking to steal your money.
org.coursera.android,"The app is excellent in its structure. However, i do have a reason to be placing 3 stars. While the interface and videos are exemplary, there is a deep issue with the peer review system. Wherever i review my peers on Coursera, there seems to be a problem. My entire app freezes. It has completely frozen my phone, twice, and i was left multiple times when i wrote my response and it ended up deleting because the app shut. Notably so, this issue has not improved ever since i have started Coursera."
org.coursera.android,amazing platform for learning
org.coursera.android,"Coursera is a very useful and learner-friendly platform that offers high-quality courses from top universities and industry experts. The courses are well-structured with clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on assignments. It helps in building both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, and the certificates add value to my academic and professional profile. Overall, Coursera is a great platform for self-paced learning and skill development."
org.coursera.android,Coursera is an amazing learning tool but their android app needs improvement. Im learning salesforce right now and when im on my phone the youtube links dont work and some of the slideshows require me to move to the computer when its such a basic slide show that im fairly sure my phone can handle. Itd be great of during my breaks at work I could use coursera on the go.
org.coursera.android,Because of your refund policy and the course I been taking was all copied from other free platform
org.coursera.android,learning as simple
org.coursera.android,"Don't think support is even gonna read this because they're insanely ignorant but if anyone reads this before downloading just be careful. the courses themselves are amazing. but i completed a really expensive paid course last year, even have the certificate, but it won't show up on my account on the site or the app. I also paid for another course but it literally will not show up anymore. and i basically wasted my money and support is absolute garbage. I'd suggest not to waste money on this app"
org.coursera.android,I purchased one course business fundamentals for 1 month. almost completed the cource except last two assessments since it is redirectedto payment eventhough there are two more days left for due. And no response when I reported
io.linga,I LIKE YOUR APP! would buy the lifetime for sure when i'm in my payday.
io.linga,"The library is weak but other than that, it's a good app. I will buy the pro version. Also i want one more feature: Advanced book speech like elevenreader."
io.linga,It would be great if the reader's settings were saved per book. I need to actively switch between center and normal alignment when I switch between scripts and books.
io.linga,the best reading and learning languages app I ever seen! tysm who created it
io.linga,not free
io.linga,Para leer en otros idiomas es la mejor aplicación.
io.linga,it is very useful app. very easy to create flash cards. several learning modes. perfect for reading books in different languages
io.linga,"um dos melhores apps para a leitura digital. Além de ser simples e prático, é bastante eficiente para aprender um novo idioma. Merece 5 estrelas!"
io.linga,Отличное приложение для пополнения словарного запаса через чтение книг на английском. Очень приятный дизайн.
io.linga,"Absolute rubbish, I am a complete a1 at German but even the ""a1"" books have complex words and unreadability statistics, I'm not b1, SO I guess can't use the app🙄"
io.linga,"porfavor,alguna opción para activar los phrasal verbs y se pueda distinguir en el texto,los prashal verbs son de lo más importante y si en el texto las palabras se traducen individualmente pierde todo el sentido lo que se está leyendo,eso es lo único que le falta a esta app"
io.linga,The best reader for language learners I have found.
io.linga,This is a real gem for intermediate and advanced language learners!
io.linga,Really helpful
io.linga,"Great concept, and a really helpful software for learning vocabulary. The best part is that flashcards and reviewing is built in, with varied exercises, and it's all automated! I'm looking for future enhancements of the features related to flashcards, because the app has the potential to become the ultimate vocabulary learning method!"
io.linga,c'est très utile pour ouvrir des livres J'adore Lire des livres sur Linga
io.linga,"The reading book percentage appears to be calculated incorrectly. Additionally, the page navigation slider is ineffective and functions more like a brightness adjuster."
io.linga,"This is what software should be like! Such a high quality application, where I'm always amazed with the features it provide. This has been a great aid on my language learning journey."
io.linga,Perfect app to read books and learn language
io.linga,parallel text !!! we all need that !
io.linga,overall is super useful but I'd like to listen to the books and perhaps different types of exercises to review vocab
io.linga,удобно для чтения. нету рекламы
io.linga,"very nice app to practice English, I love the selection-traduction function..The only thing that I would change It has a lot of beginner levels books"
io.linga,"Very useful application for reading. But one more detail, please, add the seats field for news and articles, because I can't find the articles, for example, that I read earlier"
io.linga,great!
io.linga,"Excelente app, me gustaría que funcionara offline."
io.linga,"So, I saw the bad reviews and initially decided not to download it, but I did anyway. I’m glad you guys fixed some of the major issues people were complaining about. Overall, the app is great — my only nitpick would be the short catalog of stories, this is the only thing holding me from getting the premium."
io.linga,love it
io.linga,The best reader for language learning!!!
io.linga,Best supplement to Busuu or Duolingo..but hey it's a little bit pricey..add more functionality to reach that price

air.com.starfall.more,the best nostaligic game i ever see
air.com.starfall.more,Very annoying that this does support family library. My daughter can't have full access on her own google acct on her tablet bc she's a minor which you can't create account/subscribe for full access on her google account and her account is family linked to mine for subscriptions to be approved through me. You need reconsider and utilize family library.
air.com.starfall.more,cause it counts to six seven and now i know its brainrot
air.com.starfall.more,everything is premium nothing is free
air.com.starfall.more,you guys are th
com.audible.application,"Loved it when i first started using it but now it is becoming more and more unstable. Random crashes, failures to sync sometimes over hours of listening even with the latest update Please fix or I will have to stop using for all but nostalgia relistenings."
com.audible.application,still being billed after unsubscribe over a year ago.
com.audible.application,I absolutely love audible. convenient. Great offline and online and incredible selection.
com.audible.application,tip top
com.audible.application,Great app. I am dyslexic so reading has always been hard for me. Audible made me fall in love with books and enjoy literature. It has allowed me to listen to books that I never would have read. For example I have listened to a 37 hour audiobook several times. The overall sound quality and user interface is brilliant. However the one down side is the subscription is quite expensive for what you get I would be much happier with two credits a month to get an Amazon subscription for everything.
com.audible.application,Overall great app
com.audible.application,"Very buggy. The app randomly reverts my listening to a prior bookmark position every time I re-enter to pick up where I left off. This is most annoying when listening in the car. Stop for fuel after 1 hour of driving and listening, get back in and you're back to an hour prior. Very annoying. Only fix seems to be uninstall, reinstall every week...."
com.audible.application,"I'll be testing out audible for the next 3 months. So far so good. I went in blind bc I couldn't find a tutorial on what to do. I only get one free novel a month so that is disappointing. I was hoping for 2 a month. I found that a lot of the books I have purchased on Kindle are available in audible. However, I have looked up a few and audible wants me to buy them again. So I need to figure that out."
com.audible.application,using audible has helped me get back into reading. it hasn't failed me yet!
com.audible.application,love that we can speed up the vocals.
com.audible.application,it's amazing
com.audible.application,I love the credit system. I forget about it for a year and then I binge all 12 credits
com.audible.application,"honestly the best way to experience books in my own opinion, I may be a bit spoiled for saying it but by far the best of the best readers and the vast amazing library of content just puts it a step above the rest."
com.audible.application,"after recent update, this app crashes all the time. i have to restart what im listening to and hope i can get to the last spot before another crash. wish i didnt waste money 'buying' audio books through audible and do not want to lose the almost 200 books i have. recent updates have not fixed issue, only job of app is to play audiobooks i 'purchased' and cannot manage that, subscription is cancelled."
com.audible.application,a great place to spend time!
com.audible.application,"Still using the app, but it crashes all the time. Literally cant even pull up some of the stats. Listening Stats always crashes."
com.audible.application,"This app goes through so many changes, it's hard to keep up. I set play back at 1.5 for almost every book. It helps with poor narration. This app used to keep the play back at 1.5 but now when going from one book to another, it ALWAYS goes back to 1.0. Making it very difficult to fix while driving (not to mention illegal and dangerous)!!! Thanks a whole lot Audible. Fix your freaking app!"
com.audible.application,Great experience
com.audible.application,"unable to log in through the page, their help desk is a bunch of circular references that offer no help"
com.audible.application,awesome 💯😎
com.audible.application,Great App. Works well.
com.audible.application,love it
com.audible.application,"Does not sync location from other devices to watch making the Wear app near worthless. Edit: Attempted developers recommended resolution without improvement. Option did not exist in Wear (watch) app but was able to toggle it in phone app. Also attempted logging out and reinstalling both without change in behavior. Edit 2: Contacted support through app and was told that ""Android watch is not compatible to sync with Audible at the moment."""
com.audible.application,easy to use
com.audible.application,"I can listen and get so much done simultaneously. And they have so many titles to choose from, you'll never get bored. I absolutely love it!"
com.audible.application,I love this app I put my ear buds in and listen while I work and during my workouts
com.audible.application,Best app ever. great for long drives.
com.audible.application,my daughter loves it because it helps her sleep
com.audible.application,great app for audiobooks. like that there are occasionally sales and also a borrowing library included with the membership. only downside is it is no longer privately owned and you cannot return an audiobook unless it was purchased by a credit.
com.audible.application,great app and really user friendly

com.linkedin.android.learning,"love the content that stays relevant with the times and cuts across multiple and transferable skills downsides: 1. the latency when doing some courses sometimes. i hear similar complaints from others too and is regardless of device type or OS 2. course switches chapter when rotate from landscape back to portrait not seamless overall with the above, it is hard to consume the great content."
com.linkedin.android.learning,easy
com.linkedin.android.learning,awesome
com.linkedin.android.learning,very useful and well organised courses...
com.linkedin.android.learning,Excellent
com.linkedin.android.learning,nice
com.linkedin.android.learning,I waste lot of data trying to activate it and now those key do not want to open
com.linkedin.android.learning,courses are divided in various parts rather than a complete modules. that's why it is difficult to understand what is the exact module of the topic.
com.linkedin.android.learning,good
com.linkedin.android.learning,its a mazing
com.linkedin.android.learning,Great options to choose from.
com.linkedin.android.learning,awesome 😎

com.linkedin.android.learning,interesting platform
com.linkedin.android.learning,"Awesome, efficient and practical way of learning. Just love it 😍"
com.linkedin.android.learning,very educational
com.linkedin.android.learning,learning made easy
com.linkedin.android.learning,"I downloaded the app and I've been trying to sign up but to no avail.. Anytime I reach the robot detection part, I get all the images right but it continues saying error.. Even when verifying either with my number or email. It keeps saying error. I've seen a lot of good reviews about this app but I've not been able to sign up."
com.linkedin.android.learning,Fun and informative
com.linkedin.android.learning,App interface is great. Work pays for access so I can't speak for pricing.
com.linkedin.android.learning,trash
com.linkedin.android.learning,I think this is giving back to the community.thr app is good

com.linkedin.android.learning,marvelous 🤩

com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,very helpful for review and practice
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,I love the simple design. It helps me focus on studying.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"I tried many other apps for conjugation, this one has the best style...."
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Amazing experience! Very helpful for refreshing my memory when it comes to French conjugation.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Je l'adore - Perfect to learn and drill new verbs as well as the conjunctions. Devs: here you have your support. de rien! :)
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,It's a handy reference app to have if you are learning French and just need to know how to conjugate a verb. You can look up any tense for almost any verb or you can also use it to practice conjugation through short tests. Very useful!
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"I've had purchased this app, it worked for certain period of time, later it started showing error 'Unfortunately not able to open this app'. I reinstall ed it.. started working but as soon as I used restore purchase option it verified me and unlocked the interface and then same above issue occurred."
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,perfect
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,A pretty good app that lets you get instant feedback while filling out grammar conjugation tables.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,it's shocking how quickly I'm learning my conjugations! This app is a sure fire way to get them nailed down!
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"Very nice , user friendly"
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Very convenient; it's worth it!
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"I tried like a dozen french verbs conjugators. Finally got this one, paid for all the content. Its the best one out there ive tried. Still, I dont know why I can not remove tenses and keep the ones i want when checking out particular verbs. Not talking bout the tests, great there. Talking about reviewimg the verbs. Theres a lot there I dont need."
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Very Very Good. How do I upgrade to the full version?
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,I had purchased this app.. now they are not restoring my purchase.. and when it was purchased the app used to stop working.. this is scam so please do not purchase this one..
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Enjoy this app as it is easy to use and practice with. Being able to make your own practice lists and reference a chart to see the tenses have been helpful. One of the better conjunction apps I've tried.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"Good app, could be better if it included futur proche tense (which is actually used in spoken French), labeled ""futur simple"" as such rather than just ""futur"", allowed you to filter out tenses you don't care about in settings, and added a search bar at the top of the verbs list so you don't need to scroll through a few hundred to find the one you want."
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,tres drole
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,such a great and simple app for learning conjugation. love that I can make my own list too
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,great for pure verb drills. It would be cool with a few modifications to make it easier to type and focus on what you're trying to learn.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,This little app is an excellent addition to language learning. This isn't a language tutor it's strictly conjugation but it's such a help! Small bites you can do anywhere focusing on the specific verbs and tenses you need. A little practice with this will greatly boost your knowledge and free you to concentrate on actually expressing yourself rather than fumbling with tenses and verb forms. The low price makes the full version a no brainer. Highly recommended for the French boîte de outils
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"The idea is good, but the pronunciation is quite poor on my phone. je suis, is pronounced gee swiss, and nagement, is pronounced nahj e ment. I know these pronunciations are wrong, so I know I can't trust the rest either. Without proper pronunciations, I probably won't keep the app, though I do like the interface."
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,took a little while to work out it's functionality and then a little while how to make best use of it! but once there it becomes invaluable 👍
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Simple User Interface but Good User experience... Providing help and instruction with detailed explaination either.. 5 stars
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,what i was looking for but needs some exercises of phrases
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,Very useful app! the clear examples and tense explanations really help except that there are some small mistakes in the phrases and there aren't any reflexive verb in the list. other than that it's very good. Great job!
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"Great app. A couple of improvements 1. Could do with highlighting the stem and the type of verb e.g ER/IR/RE when running tests. 2. Could do with being able to convert each conjugation to show the English e.g I went, you went, he went or I will go, you will go, he will go etc etc Overall well worth the money though, a few tweaks would make it a 5* without question"
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,"excelente aplicación para aprender a. conjugar y a memorizar verbos, tiene pronunciacion lo cual es muy valioso, mucho contenido pasado presente futuro etc. y es accesible 100% recomendada y esta en español!"
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,perfect for perfecting your grammar! every time I have a few minutes I do a few rounds and it really helps.
com.dreambear.conjuu.fr,so handy to practice my conjugation

co.riiid.vida,"I say it's a decent app but damn is there a lot of pay walls, you can't even practice the things you actually want to practice without it telling you to sign up for a subscription."
co.riiid.vida,今天被朋友推薦使用這款多益出題AI APP，介面簡潔好使用，還可以預測自己的多益分數，能夠把握自己的程度在哪個range裡，回答題目後還可以再問AI題目的詳解，是現代衝刺金色多益的好工具！
co.riiid.vida,예측점수가 높으면 기본적으로 제공하는 문제역시 그만큼 난이도있는 혹은 취약부분에 대한 문제 위주로 나왔으면 합니다.. 계속해서 쉬운 난이도의 문제를주기에 예측 점수는 높아졌지만 정말 학습진행이 된건지 의문이들어 스스로 취약부분을 따로 풀어보니 상당히 어려웠고 문제를 풀고나니 예측점수가 대폭 감소하는데 30 일동안 만들어지고 큰변동 없던 점수가 한번에 내려가는걸 보니 점수예측에 관한 신뢰가 조금 힘들어집니다.
co.riiid.vida,unusable without paying 150 dollars a month
co.riiid.vida,"Honestly, hands down, the best TORIC prep tool, got me a golden certificate. The AI prediction is unbelievably accurate. Now if there's a JLPT one it'll be a god sent."
co.riiid.vida,"It's just error messages, useless app that doesn't work."
co.riiid.vida,非常有用的app，三年來一直使用帶著我的成績節節高，希望這次能繼續帶我突破！
co.riiid.vida,半年間、有料プランでお世話になりました。TOEICを、620点から、910点まで伸ばすことができました。本当に感謝しています。
co.riiid.vida,"I believe this app is a valuable tool for preparing for the TOEIC test. It provides ten to twenty questions for users who are trying out the application, which I think is sufficient for those looking to prepare for the test over an extended period."
co.riiid.vida,am broke how could i afford $150 for monthly subscription
co.riiid.vida,Cannot even open just showing error messages
co.riiid.vida,"I can't believe how accurate the AI was!! This app was predicted that I would get 845 point in this test. Today (11NOV'24) is the date for the result of the test held at 27OCT'24, and I get 825 point in this test!! IT WAS CRAZY!! I would suggest everyone who want to attend the TOEIC test to use this app previously to improve the skill and experience this app!!,"
co.riiid.vida,good app
co.riiid.vida,サブスクしてるのに広告が出る 長文の翻訳がかなり雑なので信じない方がいい
co.riiid.vida,다 좋은데 버그가 있어요. 얼른 해결 부탁드려요. 고객센터 메일 적어주시면 버그 영상 보내드릴게요. 1. 어휘 암기중인데 동일한 단어가 나왔어오. 2. 버그에 걸렸는지 몰라요 알아요 뜻보기 눌러도 넘어가지 않고 무한 반복이에요. 3. Pc랑 모바일이랑 같아요.

co.riiid.vida,good
co.riiid.vida,必要な機能や学習内容は備わっているけど、回答で納得いかないものが結構ある。文法問題以外だと解説も雑。 制作者は、もう一度問題を見直して文脈上どっちでも成立しうるものがないか確認してほしい。

co.riiid.vida,It is a useful tool to learning English
co.riiid.vida,I love this app. It's useful in learning Toeic.
co.riiid.vida,文字のサイズを調整（大きく）出来るようにしてほしいです。宜しくお願いします。
co.riiid.vida,"I haven't subscribed yet. Test scores start high and increase when I retry, which is odd. The app functions well, but it's unclear which features are free or paid. It says ""You do not have permissions for the selected study"" without explaining the restriction duration. Yesterday, I couldn't access a study, now I can, then I can't again. Limitations are unclear. The cost is too high for me, and I don't see the value in buying it with current results."
co.riiid.vida,very good
co.riiid.vida,wonderful
co.riiid.vida,perfect
co.riiid.vida,かなり使いやすくて良いアプリです。 要望として、テーマアイコンを導入検討いただきたいです。（ic_launcher.xmlにmonochrome設定するだけで、工数かなり少ないと思うのでやってほしいです） また、dictationの問題のボタンがかなり小さく押しづらく感じたため、最低でも48.dp確保してほしいです。
co.riiid.vida,good

com.hello.french,5 stars deserved
com.hello.french,Wow!!! Blown away! This is the best way to learn a language. The developers put in a lot of work to structure this app such that it caters to readers/learners of all levels. Every word is translated and shown how it is used in context. Grammar rules are explained in depth and the daily exercises ensure that you learn every word and understand what it means.
com.hello.french,"definitely more of a mature app than duo in just a few minutes I realized this app will take me a lot farther in my desire to learn a language by actually teaching things that can be used in real time applications with less unnecessary stuff like leagues and gaming mentality that do not interest me, or teach anything."
com.hello.french,"This is an amazing app to learn a new language, I am using it to learn french and it makes language learning so easy. I wish I knew about it earlier, but either way I am happy to have found it. super 💯💯💯."
com.hello.french,"the app is easy to use and understand, and it teaches quite well too in a way that's not overwhelming. it's quite effective, but a lot of the content is limited. either way, i still enjoyed it quite a lot!"
com.hello.french,The app is beautiful and I love that there are various options that help a beginner. I just hope that they translate the title of the article in french as well and if they can add one or two more paragraphs in the articles. I love to read more and improve. Otherwise no issue at all.
com.hello.french,nice app
com.hello.french,"this app is really good. it makes it easier to learn french, because you see how the words are used in context. give it a shot, you won't regret it!"
com.hello.french,"one of the greatest and most useful ones. please add italian, too. it's gonna be so popular and necessary"
com.hello.french,easy. beautiful great
com.hello.french,"I have a problem, Iam trying to subscribe but it always refuses paying by Vodafone, I don't know the reason. could you help me with that?"
com.hello.french,very good but i hope to have this app for free.
com.hello.french,"It's a very user friendly app to learn french with grammar, verb conjugation and listening too... Highly recommend !"
com.hello.french,"I like this app, no ads, no disruption you can learn to read, write, listen and speak french with this app. it teaches you the words, grammar and pronunciation Overall I can say it is a good helping tool for those who are learning french."
com.hello.french,"hi,im student who struggle to get my vocabolaire French better after many years,I use many apps,but they don't work for me,untile i find someone on YouTube talk about app that well help,when i hear about your app,i downloaded and it was and still to this day,best app from reading book, practice.etc..."
com.hello.french,"currently can save only a single word or a pre-defined expression, but adding the ability to save several words in a row, e.g. some custom expression would make the app almost perfect"
com.hello.french,It's a great app
com.hello.french,great app
com.hello.french,"this is a lovely and useful app to practice language and learn about new stuff, although it needs a subscription for further reading of some long articles which in some countries like Afghanistan people might not be able to provide..."
com.hello.french,Best app ever.
com.hello.french,good
com.hello.french,Wow
com.hello.french,Great tool for reading and vocabulary as well as grammar
com.hello.french,"There is no need to go through 2-3 paragraphs and suddenly get the frustration and disappointment of: ""No more unless you pay"". The experience didn't even last 1 minute. God bless Google Translate which is all free and nearly does the same thing."
com.hello.french,good but expensive
com.hello.french,this coupled w Duolingo is a gr8 combo to upgrade any language
com.hello.french,Very good app
com.hello.french,super
com.hello.french,this is exactly what I have been looking for! an app that makes learning to read French accessable
com.hello.french,It's a very good app.. I love it 😀
com.moonbug.blippilearn,My son loves Blippi and was very excited to try this new game. He was not disappointed and its keeping him entertained! Was a bit worried when I saw previous comments about bugs but looks like thats all sorted now as we've had no issues
com.moonbug.blippilearn,fantastic
com.moonbug.blippilearn,Perfect for Blippi fans
com.moonbug.blippilearn,Best app ever! The perfect game for my niece and nephew
com.moonbug.blippilearn,It functions really well and is fun and engaging for kids!
com.moonbug.blippilearn,Finally an app for my kids that doesn't crash all the time!!! Love this
com.moonbug.blippilearn,so much memorys when i was a kid best game
com.moonbug.blippilearn,ok till it crashed very addictive though...
com.moonbug.blippilearn,i like it
com.moonbug.blippilearn,The FIRST thing you are greeted to is a subscription pass... I think we will pass.
com.moonbug.blippilearn,"I would buy the game if there was an option. At $54cad a YEAR for a handful of mini games is absolutely crazy. That price is crazy for a full blown console game, let alone a childs phone app. Should be renamed to Blippis Greed Club. would give zero stars if I could. you guys over there at Moonbeam are out of touch."
com.moonbug.blippilearn,Perfect for Blippi fans!
com.moonbug.blippilearn,little frustrating with no music.
com.moonbug.blippilearn,"My kids love Blippi, so when he sold out to Moonbug, we knew a cost for his content would definitely happen! This app is a perfect example. Offers one 3m repeat video, no games, no interaction, just a Paywall for the same content and items you can get elsewhere free. Don't bother, just another corporate cash grab using kids!"
com.moonbug.blippilearn,It Is Great.
com.moonbug.blippilearn,I have never seen this random ahh trash game I've never touched it and keeps on downloading itself😠💩
com.moonbug.blippilearn,First to install right? OMG THANKSSS
com.moonbug.blippilearn,"its an ok app, crashes too often for £30/year or £6 a month."
com.moonbug.blippilearn,It's just a black screen after the title screen. Will change the review when I actually see the app
com.moonbug.blippilearn,I can't enter the app stay black
com.moonbug.blippilearn,fun for kids etc.
deezer.android.app,"It would be great to have a shuffle-all tracks option on artist profiles, a quick shuffle button on playlists, and a way to start a radio from any song or artist. Additionally, seamless integration with Google Nest would be a significant advantage. Currently, the system feels somewhat clunky, and there's definitely room for improvement."
deezer.android.app,grande acervo música. app fluido e fácil de mexer.
deezer.android.app,"only one way now, Deezer!"
deezer.android.app,lovely
deezer.android.app,"brilliant service, so easy to use, and great variety"
deezer.android.app,I love the anti-genAI features. There's nothing quite like it on the market. All of the other features are pretty standard for music apps but good nonetheless.
deezer.android.app,limited songs you can like
deezer.android.app,Spotify but better!
deezer.android.app,app is super buggy
deezer.android.app,"I liked it... but why can't I flip the default filter when music is imported? It's backwards to me, also why can I not view songs from my playlist on android auto? it just automatically starts from the top when I choose a playlist from the android auto screen. Spotify and Qobuz don't do that and Qobuz has team half the size."
deezer.android.app,"No free music/trial without giving payment details. Keep getting an email I cannot unsubscribe from reminding me to 'pick my artists', which I can see no way to do via app or web. No Deezer Connect. Cannot close account either. Complete joke of a service."
deezer.android.app,"Cast doesn't work every now and then, UI has flaws (f.e. it's always hard to find a currently playing track in Now Plaing view with queue, there is no salient marker)."
deezer.android.app,"Pros: + (limited list of) podcasts are included, no need for a separate app or account + able to ""ban"" songs/artists from playing in mixes, etc Cons: - can't add podcast episodes or tracks to queue if listening to a mix - sometimes app straight up doesn't work or tracks won't play. Gets stuck in a ""loading"" loop forever. This is the biggest con and I HATE it. - limited podcasts & tracks available - ffw / rewind is set at 30 seconds. Can't change this."
deezer.android.app,me encanta el algoritmo
deezer.android.app,why do I need to pay to listen to a damn song? Like bruv wdym...
deezer.android.app,"it's not Spotify, which is great. service is phenomenal, music quality is top tier, and I don't feel the guilt of supporting a trash company."
deezer.android.app,You can't create an acc without telling them you are one of three gender options and there's no way to opt out. There's nothing that turns me off of a service like gender categories you HAVE to use gd. I just wannna to listen to music I like and block artists that I don't.
deezer.android.app,"it's a little spotty sometimes, and drops out in the middle of songs, but other than that it's a solid music player, pair it with a nice pair of headphones or earbuds to really take advantage of the HQ and HIFI sound quality, however one thing that isn't mentioned is that you have to pay a small fee in order to transfer all of your files/songs over from spotify, apple music etc"
deezer.android.app,"The audio is fine, even though there's some stuff missing that other apps have. What really bothers me is that this app keeps eating up space from the moment you start streaming, and you can't clear the cache like on Spotify to free up the space. You have to uninstall and install again."
deezer.android.app,"needs a duo plan in NZ, too expensive"
deezer.android.app,it keeps playing songs that aren't even on my Playlist when I play my Playlist (JUST LET ME LISTEN TO MY SONG:>()
deezer.android.app,Ils ont retiré la possibilité de contrôler la musique du salon depuis le téléphone. C'est dommage.
deezer.android.app,"Not working while calls, Spotify works while calls."
deezer.android.app,I like this and it's good u can listen to music while in other apps. I recommend this.
deezer.android.app,"im a new user and this is my thoughts if you plan on getting this app: get a computer and log in on both the mobile version and computer version. its much easier to use and create playlists on computer. the format for playlists is different on spotify from deezer, whatever songs you add first will be at the bottom of the playlist instead of the top. My main issue so far is you cant move songs in you're Playlist around without it glitching and saying its at the top which is extremely annoying."
deezer.android.app,Auf Deezer is verlass. thumbs up 👍
deezer.android.app,"Dezeer, kenapa beberapa playlist musik di wilayah saya tidak bisa diputar? apakah ada masalah?"
deezer.android.app,"It's good in theory, but poor execution. It has less ads than Spotify, and still has smaller artists compared to other apps. However when I want to play a playlist it will play mixes inspired by the playlist rather than the songs on the playlist and you get a single skip. If these issues were fixed I'd 100% use this app again."
deezer.android.app,Great work.
deezer.android.app,good range of music
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,love the option between farming and fighting. im really into learning thanks to this 😍
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"what a great way to learn languages. despite it not seeming like a lot, learning languages through games is an amazing feature and can often help others a lot more than educational settings such as lessons or classrooms. the games are fun, engaging, and what an easy app to use! only giving it 4 stars because of their lack of languages. i settled for latin american spanish but i really wanted to see norwegian or some swedish."
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I love how rewarding but also not restrictive this game is
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,for the past 6 months I've been using this to learn spanish. its been great. I'm talking with my customers in spanish!
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,this is an awesome way to learn a language. it feels like a game.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I don't like this game that much because you have to sign into your account and then you have to subscribe to just play the game 😔😔
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"Very fun and cute! reminds me of Prodigy, but the learning is less obtrusive in this game. so its easier to want to keep playing :)"
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"haven't played it, it didn't have my language I want to practice! I would love to see Ukrainian on here! will try out if it ever comes!"
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,fun and you really start learning immediately if you are a beginner. I was going to try it out in intermediate in another language as well. you can switch between different languages and skill levels. seems neat so far.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"this game is very fun, i love the medieval-like music and i'm learning useful words that other apps just don't or do it after a year you used them, I also like that you learn some words without having to force yourself too much because of the lil games, I LOVE THIS GAME!!"
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"Premium is not at all necessary, and the game play is engaging. Having a farming mode and fighting mode so most everyone should be happy. It has many languages and dilects too."
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"Edited from 5* to 4* because I bought premium and already finished the combat story path in two weeks 😭 .. I just started playing today and this game is REALLY fun and effective. The music is good and the animations are cute. It gives you a choice to do farming or combat. I'm a combat girl. The card combat is really fun with good cards to build a deck with so far. For language learning, I'm REALLY enjoying it so far. It has flash cards and words are voiced, and it's repetitive enough to get it!"
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,its genuinely a really fun way to learn a language
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,Very fun and engaging in learning a new language :)
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,Just started and I do enjoy the cards and getting to go through them as often as I like. But the actual game play is tedious and so far has absolutely nothing to do with the language I'm trying to learn. Maybe if the characters used the words and phrases it would make more sense. I'm on the non pay version so I don't know if language immersion is part of the premium. I just don't see the point of the farm and adventures when they so far have zero to do with learning a language.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I love how you don't have to buy something to do more
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,This game is great! I have had a hard time finding an app which would give me enough content to learn anything new but this game gives you plenty of free content while making it fun. you don't have to buy anything and it has helped me with grammatical things in certain languages I couldn't quite get until now.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I got a notification for this through Facebook and I never gave permission for that connection. Immediately uninstalled.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,A fun and unique way to learn a new language. I love the integration of learning new words to successfully use cards in battle. It's also cute and family friendly and a great way to get young ones into learning.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"Wait a minute! You give someone a Kanji that they don't know, representing a word that they don't understand, and you call that ""teaching vocabulary""?!? Teach is the words first, then give us the Kanji. Of course, I shouldn't be implying that I use your service. I don't. you're advertisement makes it obvious that you're not in this to teach us, but instead you're in this to spite them."
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,this is a bad way to learn Japanese. The way that they make you try to stitch together words and sentences in two character chunks is annoying.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,fun way to learn a language and keep you motivated.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"No Irish ok updated my rating because the developer took the time to reply. I bumped it to 3. Gaeilge always get ignored even though 31 million people claim to be Irish. developer if you read this update, please make a list available before someone takes the time to download and jump through the hoops only to find out their language isn't supported."
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"Well, I'm 11 and most kids my age think that the only good video games are ones with either guns or memes and I think that this game is better than any of those and I've learned so much since I've started playing it, so if you're reading this, you should totally try Lingo Legend (Just so you know, I used speech to text so if there are mistakes it's not my fault).😁"
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I'm learning really
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I've been using Duolingo for a year and have not missed a day. I feel like I've hit a wall but this app has brought me beyond that. Playing the game is fun but the best part is I'm quickly expanding my vocabulary and conversational skills by learning new phrases. Though you can do a lot without premium I'll probably pay for it here and forgo renewing my Duolingo.
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,Cute and fun game! The dialogue is entertaining and so far the learning style is great. 😊
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"from what I've played so far, it's very intuitive but is also helping me learn Japanese. there are no forced ads and is very chill-paced. love it <3"
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,I can play games and still feel productive. Perfect for procrastinating other things. Gracias!
com.hyperthought.lingolegend,"I've been using this app on and off and so far I am satisfied. Just haven't had enough motivation to practice but I really, REALLY like the gamified interface. When you're learning more difficult languages such as Mandarin and Korean, it could be a huge help and makes the process fun."

com.podbean.app.podcast,"Latest update absolutely destroyed the experience. the options for organizing your downloads does not include grouping same podcast episodes in list form. either you get grouped as single podcast, but you're not able to organize them. or you can organize them by when you downloaded them, or when they were published. but, you can't organize them the way that you've always been able to! by when you downloaded them, grouped by podcast.

Most of the other big names that have podcasts, don't seem to let me connect to the ones I ACTUALLY want to listen to, which is super frustrating. Podbean lets me listen to ones I'm interested in, which have value to me, and aren't endorsed by the huge studios, and censor voices they don't like! High quality app!"

com.triaxo.nkenne,Good tutor
com.triaxo.nkenne,Not all languages are included
com.triaxo.nkenne,it's a very good application
com.triaxo.nkenne,"This is a much needed app, in my opinion, which is why I'm sharing this feedback for improvement to reach its full potential. • A lot of times, lessons that are done show as locked when you come back in the app • The switch between the sexes of the speakers can be confusing – pronouns and actions • The narratives don't make a lot of sense in some lessons – not the worst, but it's worth mentioning because they start out as a story. • I'm unsure about some pronunciations. E.g., food and ten."
com.triaxo.nkenne,"I'm not Yoruba but now I can understand and speak very well, all thanks to this wonderful app"
com.triaxo.nkenne,with Nkenne app learning language is very easy indeed! This app is awesome 👍
com.triaxo.nkenne,"The reason I'm not giving this app a five star review is because you can't minimize the app and listen to it like an audio player. When you minimize it, it only plays for a brief period then stops playing. The developer should consider making the app to play continuously even after it has been minimized. Also it'll be nice to have a toggle button to keep the backlight on while you're in the app because currently one has to continue tapping on the screen repeatedly to keep the backlight on."

com.triaxo.nkenne,Using for two days now and the learning structure is quite impressive. But please add dark mode to the app as using the app for long periods hurts the eyes.

bc.leg,"Content is good. But the app development is awful. If you mistakenly press back button in the middle of a test, you're cooked. You'll have to start over once again. Too many ads!!!"
bc.leg,Best grammar app yeah
bc.leg,Good
bc.leg,"Aplicación muy básica, con ejercicios bastante simples que no se diferencian mucho de lo que se puede investigar por cuenta propia. Creo que al estar diseñada por British Council podrían aportar más.

bc.leg,Nice ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
bc.leg,This app is more helpful to learn English grammar.
bc.leg,Good
bc.leg,I suggest this app for those who want to improve their skills in English literature. it's very good and the app also provide us with some questions to see if we are improving our English language.
bc.leg,I thought this have subject matter study lesson but this is just quiz.
bc.leg,"I always receive ad notifications to remove ads by in-app purchase but I already bought it. If I tab, it says I've already purchased. Please stop these annoying notifications! They come at least one time ever week. Don't any of you use this app yourselfes?"
bc.leg,You're so cruel. You make a good app. Then you include ads WITH VIDEOS. This makes the app too expensive to use for students. Do you understand that my students don't have jobs? They are students. They don't have spare money to spend on watching your silly video ads.
bc.leg,"The answer is ""Yes, I am."", My answer ""yes, i am"" but wrong"
bc.leg,"A really good app for practicing english. it's very fun too. but WHY ARE THERe SOO MANY ADS? I'm offline,and still there are so many ads now that if I'm playing this app for three hours one hour is wasted on ads.please fix it"

com.nemoapps.android.japanese,"This is my second Nemo language and I have bought this one too. They are a bargain. I wanted Japanese flahcards of relevant vocabulary. After looking around, I remembered that Nemo has these ... as well as a phrase book and audio files to aid pronunciation. Definitely a bargain."
com.nemoapps.android.japanese,Easy to use flashcard system
com.nemoapps.android.japanese,Very easy to use and a fantastic app

com.nemoapps.android.japanese,ดี
com.nemoapps.android.japanese,good
com.nemoapps.android.japanese,I love japanese Nemo super easy to used
com.nemoapps.android.japanese,"Using the Nemo language app is great! You don't just learn most of every phrase. It also simplifies what each word translates while you read the word & listen to how it's pronounced. If you want to learn a new language the proper way, don't just rely on this app alone. I recommend you buy yourself a text book & a good enough pen so you can make a note of the translations when you have a better chance of remembering in your head & do not loose this textbook you have, it's important!"
com.nemoapps.android.japanese,That is such an informative app...i really like that app...that app help me so much...
com.nemoapps.android.japanese,Nemo apps on andriod need to be the sams as or better than the ones on apple.

com.grammarly.android.keyboard,useful tool
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"This is a perfect app. It really helps you focus your writing skills. It is excellent in every way, but I can't afford to get an upgrade. It is awesome without the upgrade, believe me... but I would love to buy the upgrade to get help with punctuation. You will not find a better app, anywhere."
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,I can't live without Grammarly; this app has helped me through some challenging writing moments.
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"The app is great when it works. I'm using the free option. The icon appears on my screen, and I'll have typos it should have prompted me to correct, but it just shows ""no more suggestions."" So I check all my settings and nothing is turned off. I'll uninstall and reinstall then it works again. I thought maybe it's because I'm using the free version, but when I checked it says that I should should still get grammar and spelling. Mof, this entire review passed with ""no more suggestions."""
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"Fix more grammar mistakes and bugs, and others, because Grammarly should also add an Irish English language section"
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,best app
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,best
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"I used to love this app and would’ve rated it five stars. The floating overlay and in-context rewrites were the only reason I kept Grammarly installed. Now the free tier gives you one rewrite per day, which completely kills the experience. Once that’s gone, the app is basically useless. I’ll be removing Grammarly from all my devices. The Pro subscription is wildly overpriced for what it offers, especially when other AI services provide far more features for the same or lower cost. Paywall demo"
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,I love this app
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"helps a great deal when you accidentally miss a word. The app has some features you have to personalize. However, that is good because you can customize it to your liking. been a user for years. best assistant on my team."
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,This app is a valuable partner.
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,nice & good
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"It helps me improve my English, and it's useful for me while I do my writing, speaking and in daily conversations ( live confess to crush 😁🤭 )"
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"I really hate this app when registering using E-mail, do we really need to register the same password we use in our E-mail? It is our personal E-mail and you are invading our privacy. Never trust this kind of app so better not to use it."
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,very good
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,Great
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,is nice and easy to make it right
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,I love it
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,It helped my grammar mistakes.
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"I love this app 😁 It came pre-installed on my phone and I really got used to it backing me up, but I lost it after an update. I couldn't figure out how to get it back and missed it so much that I went to the Geek Squad for help. Now I'm back in business!"
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,Too good 👍
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"This app is Amazing, keep developing it, I am honestly enjoying it"
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,it's perfect
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,veryhelful
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,so nice
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,all good after help from customer support 👍
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,"The latest update has rendered the app completely useless, time to find a new one. What a waste of money."
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,Why did you have to limit rewrites of tone to just 1 prompt a day to the pro version? How am I gonna use this now for my scripts? 😒😞 After the update it became unreliable. It shows only the friendly tone and the professional option at the very beginning of the prompt. Only to find out days prior it was on premium. Can you at least give 30 - 50 prompts a day with the same interface as before where you can select different tones?
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,amazing
com.grammarly.android.keyboard,It's really good 💯😊
com.gingersoftware.writer,I had to pay twice for annual premium subscription. No refunds of course. I very much regret buying Ginger as it is the worst junk. I am back using Grammarly again as it is superior to Ginger
com.gingersoftware.writer,"No easy way to use it - there is no floating button like in QuillBot and stopping what I write because I need to open Ginger manually is tedious. Personally I would prefer it to be in the ""Share menu"" like with Google Translate - so we can share to Ginger and a little floating window pops up with corrections. Add more languages."
com.gingersoftware.writer,it has bugs keep on stopping by itself
com.gingersoftware.writer,The app is performing exceptionally well.
com.gingersoftware.writer,to low q word limit making it useless
com.gingersoftware.writer,this is really wonderful app. but it doesn't support any other languages please add other languages such as french Spanish.... keep going and be pationate about...
com.gingersoftware.writer,Rephraser is good but not sentence corrector and premium after 80 rephrase।
com.gingersoftware.writer,"This app is helpful, but it can be grammatically incorrect at times."
com.gingersoftware.writer,good
com.gingersoftware.writer,This app is a great advantage for me. Every now and then I'm not sure of the correct spelling so just saying the word and getting the correct answer is fabulous!! Thank you!!!
com.gingersoftware.writer,good
com.gingersoftware.writer,Good
com.gingersoftware.writer,I do like it it help me out on school work and on my job.
com.gingersoftware.writer,The most incredible application I have ever seen. It's something I really love. Ginger's correction of my grammatical mistakes and rephrases my sentences have given me confidence in writing anything.
com.gingersoftware.writer,excellent
com.gingersoftware.writer,nice
com.gingersoftware.writer,Maha bakwas
com.gingersoftware.writer,gud
com.gingersoftware.writer,My data is not encrypted on transit. I won't risk using the app.
com.gingersoftware.writer,Absolutely love this app. Please never change.
com.gingersoftware.writer,"Not upto the mark, and the subscription is way to costly. Not recommended 👎"
com.gingersoftware.writer,Please provide an update in Malayalam. Soon ...
com.gingersoftware.writer,"We have plenty of new AI featured app for Free. You are so restricted. I cannot check line by line, instead you need rephrase all sentences."
com.gingersoftware.writer,Bad
com.gingersoftware.writer,Perfect
com.gingersoftware.writer,"This Android app can delete all your selected sentences when you want to use rephrasing. Once deleted, there is no way to recover. This bug has hurt me several times. This is very basic ux concept. You should let user recover from an error. For example, I write a text in the Ginger notepad and select all for rephrasing. However, the text somehow disappears and since there is no undo button, the entire text will be deleted. An undo button is needed for this app. It should keep all we write."
com.gingersoftware.writer,Good
com.gingersoftware.writer,This is wonderful. I will now learn more words
com.gingersoftware.writer,"If I can't get it to work I don't need it , thank you for your time ."
com.gingersoftware.writer,Great 👍
com.mosalingua.entoeic,This app does not work.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,"it's an incredible app for consuming and learning vocabulary. I really recommend it. But I would like this app to give us an option to create a deck, or flaschard by category."
com.mosalingua.entoeic,I'll hf fin j down
com.mosalingua.entoeic,"It's a great app, it helps me to increase my vocab. I like it."
com.mosalingua.entoeic,Unfortunately I can't connect to my messenger account anymore since 1 year. So I can't use the app.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,The application helped me to learn French by increasing my vocabulary through their good methodology of repetion and now I can talk to anyone in french. It is the best application for anyone to learn language effectively. I love it.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,The app is very pratice. I really love it.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,Completly approuved. But I think we already have english bases to use it. Because all traduction is in english (maybe it is just my settings).. Thanks for all work you've done since a know you. The biggest improvement is due to your app coupled with english movies. Merci à vous
com.mosalingua.entoeic,the very best app to learn languages. would like to find arabic and hebrew later on in this app. it's such a good way of learning.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,"Great. But i don t understand, the app tell me I must change level, but it seem I can t, only 105 word on learning..."
com.mosalingua.entoeic,I've been lerning a lot
com.mosalingua.entoeic,Useful !
com.mosalingua.entoeic,easy to use
com.mosalingua.entoeic,Thank you for this app. Very useful for me I put 3 stars because I am disappointed concerning your business app which is not only in English like this app (for a total immersion)
com.mosalingua.entoeic,This app is easy to use and help you to have more vocabulary for the test toeic
com.mosalingua.entoeic,This is boon for me. I'm upgrading my English skills to Super Advanced Level.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,For me it's the best way to learn foreign (or just new) words using smartphone.
com.mosalingua.entoeic,I really enjoy using this app. Thank you
com.mixlr.android,"excellent ,but can't get on the app ,need help logging in"
com.mixlr.android,since morning it's not openings
com.mixlr.android,"The interface looks a bit dated and ""tacky,"" which takes away from the professional feel of the service. The biggest issue for me is navigation. The back button often closes the entire app instead of just taking me to the previous screen, which is incredibly frustrating. Also, the search tool is way too limited it only seems to work if you have an exact match. It really needs to show ""near matches"" and broader results so we can actually discover new events easily. good work nonetheless 👏🏿"
com.mixlr.android,awesome 👍
com.mixlr.android,good
com.mixlr.android,Keep scrambling. Had to restart my phone multiple times before the app opens
com.mixlr.android,Good App
com.mixlr.android,the search bar is Paul you need to put rewind and forward button for better experience your update has no changes and no improvement
com.mixlr.android,good app
com.mixlr.android,very good
com.mixlr.android,Great
com.mixlr.android,"My experience with the app has been terrible since i last updated 4months ago. When I click on mixlr link instead of taking me to the app it takes me to a web page and then ask me for email, username, password. After which it won't still work. I use to enjoy the app with my favourite channels but not anymore. can't something be done for someone to be able to use the app without signing in creating account?"
com.mixlr.android,"This app used to be so good but now it's gotten so bad and it's sad to see. Connecting as a listener has become such a hassle, it just keeps on loading and sometimes never loads. Then when I eventually connect, it starts breaking or suddenly stops. it will be nice if these issues can be fixed for real. It's just so sad to watch the decline in efficiency. Pls figure out a way to fix."
com.mixlr.android,best experience
com.mixlr.android,not so good
com.mixlr.android,brilliant app listen to your football team
com.mixlr.android,"stops at will, you have to open it everything to restart talking, very frustrating"
com.mixlr.android,takes forever to load nowadays
com.mixlr.android,good and great 👍
com.mixlr.android,"Why can't I share to WhatsApp anymore. It only allows Bluetooth sharing and something else. No more to social media.... Plus it just lags off on ending. Absolutely loved it for a bit. I'm back in October 2025 and it's sad to say the issue is back! When I have a live audio program to connect to, the app just keeps loading until I eventually have to switch to YouTube or other apps. And funny, the same internet network will work excellently on another app. Can you look into this, please!"
com.mixlr.android,super cool for Nsppdians. please make offline download possible...that will make it super duper cool
com.mixlr.android,"why does the app take 2 minutes to load sometimes? you open it for a quick program, but it keeps loading and can take at least 1 minute to open. while this is even loading, the phone screen light goes off multiple times all while the app is still loading to open."
com.mixlr.android,"The app needs to be worked on, it takes time to load. it is quite worrisome."
com.mixlr.android,Am a tailor
com.mixlr.android,very good selection in gospel and music
com.mixlr.android,it not functioning well on my phone help me out please
com.mixlr.android,Very Good 👍👍👍👍😊😊😊😊👍👍👍😊😊😊
com.mixlr.android,We use Mixlr for Church services. The website is absolutely better than the app. The app feels unfinished and one of my main issues is that there is no dark mode on the app.
com.mixlr.android,"It's very cool and very easy to use, I encourage you to use this app."
com.mixlr.android,i dont know these app is not working on my Samsung A5 2017
org.brilliant.android,"Fun, interactive, and seamless. You will want to be with the crew and we will address it then!!"
org.brilliant.android,"There's gotta be a way to get more lessons, 1 full day is just annoying. Maybe put like, a puzzle you have to solve that's really hard and you get keys orr, but it's still a good app I recommend."
org.brilliant.android,so far so good premium would be better though otherwise it's not to shabby
org.brilliant.android,"Application is good, but would be more effective if you guys increase the daily limit. 2 keys is quite less limit."
org.brilliant.android,good
org.brilliant.android,"Brilliant is awesome. I love being able to have lessons any time I want, at my own pace. Recently, I have been wanting to learn about quadratics. I had no one to teach me so I was just going to have to wait the ~6 months for my math class to catch up. But now that I got Brilliant, I was able to complete the quadratics course in 2 days. I totally recommend getting premium, it is SO worth it. Now I can do any amount of lessons any time I want and it has really made me happy."
org.brilliant.android,"This app truly is brilliant in its interactivity and the bites bitesized approach to learning. My only criticism is the apparent use of bots in the weekly league tables. I've been in the top league for months, winning once and coming second a couple of times. My suspicion comes from the fact each week you see completely new names- and never see the same names at the top of the league- or anywhere else in it. People arrive each week, smash top place and are never seen again..."
org.brilliant.android,Sometimes the app has a buggy system but just a quick reset and all settled. Great app overall
org.brilliant.android,very useful and intuitive
org.brilliant.android,wy no dark theme🙈🥲
org.brilliant.android,"very limited material if using for free, we get only 2 lesson per day for free also we can't review completed lessons"
org.brilliant.android,"useless, honestly. it won't let you retry a lesson which is really defeating if you are trying to get the best scores possible. having to wait for another key or ending the lesson to start over just loses the current key. no rewards for streaks either. should be able to earn keys, not just wait or pay premium."
org.brilliant.android,Amazing
org.brilliant.android,Excelent app for learning STEM
org.brilliant.android,Good learning
org.brilliant.android,great app.
org.brilliant.android,it's cool
org.brilliant.android,my son found this at kurzgesagt on YouTube and brilliant is entertaining my son while teaching him
org.brilliant.android,"It's cool, wish I can afford to get the full version"
org.brilliant.android,thank y'all for keeping my brain gears un-rusted
org.brilliant.android,ممتاز ولكن من غير الاشتراك التمارين قليلة جدا أيضا لا يوجد دعم للغة العربية
org.brilliant.android,very good app
org.brilliant.android,very good application 😃👍
org.brilliant.android,I would like give some suggestions could add some widget features like for streaks and our learning progress so that it can make people get more excited
org.brilliant.android,Brilliant is the most meaningful time killer available. It has exceptional coding and a great interface.
org.brilliant.android,Best app to learn
org.brilliant.android,"Great, but ... in order to get premium I have to pay $124 for the full year?? There's no option to just pay per month?? I would subscribe to it and likely use it for at least 2 months, perhaps longer if that was an option. but paying that much for a full year up front is a lot to ask."
org.brilliant.android,IT HAS THE BEST CONCEPT FOR LEARNING. LEARNING BECOMES WAY TOO EASIER WITH THIS AAP. YOU CAN LEARN ANYTHING YOU WANNA LEARN
org.brilliant.android,"I love this app. I wanted to play with my father, you know, have some competition, but he doesn't speak English so it's not fun alone. This app needs to support other languages."
org.brilliant.android,Very relaxing and fun.
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,good for Ielts practice
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,great
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,it's exceptionally good I really love it
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,good but too much adds
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,"Don't take me for being rude but, for example if you spend 1 hour in the app 30 mins are just ads and almost every test is available only if you pay premium. And the worst part is you can't practice any skills as all the writing tests and reading tests require you to get premium which is just stupid. When i go into tips you only get the basic tips you get to know when you attend a normal IELTS Class which is stupid to be honest since we are looking for advanced tips not tips we ready know."
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,"There are no clear instructions on how to navigate through the application. Otherwise, it could have been a 5-star!"
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,wonderful
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,thanks for your generosity. But how can we purchase the premium in iran☹️
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,very bad app

com.practice.ielts.listening.test,this app is really helps me to improve my level of English
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,I love this app. it teaches all
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,first of all my heartfelt gratitude to the inventor of this app because it helps me learn new things as I open this app. It helps me learn new vocabulary and those idioms thank you 💕
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,this app really helps a lot for those trying to prepare in one week's time via the premium and the examiner section of the app
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,This is one of the best apps I've ever come across
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,Nice
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,I like the app a lot. It help me learn IELTS better and effectively. Thank you for the developer of this app.
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,it is more help full than other app
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,it's need data
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,"This app is very worst 😔 sone of the brokers are saying its very best app in whole playstore and changed their life.i want to say something to them, why are you brokers trying to misguide innocent people and the developer is also replying ' we will reduce ads in this app' why are making normal people fool 😡"
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,very nice app my IELTS band is 7.5.this app is used and practice
com.practice.ielts.listening.test,good
com.guidedelearning.flex,"Quite good, but can you please add a highlighting feature in reading and listening? Also, add additional features that allow access to more mock tests (besides the original 25 mock tests) by paying a certain amount of money?"
com.guidedelearning.flex,"The one-star rating is simply because of a major bug in the app. When I am taking an exercise and I select an answer, I can't scroll down to the other things that I should be answering 😔 PLEASE FIX IT ASAP ⚠️"
com.guidedelearning.flex,"this is the worst scam i have ever seen. do not spend a fraction of your money on their useless ai as it gives misinformation and an unclear assesment of your writings. even chatgpt is better although it isnt trained on ielts. what a load of bull. all they want is to grab your money (no refunds btw) just to tell you to write ""better"""
com.guidedelearning.flex,Great app for learning
com.guidedelearning.flex,I can't open the app
com.guidedelearning.flex,"good, I bit of confusion with the courses need some UX improvements"
com.guidedelearning.flex,Good for IELTS perperation.
com.guidedelearning.flex,I don't believe in the AI generated band score.
com.guidedelearning.flex,Absolutely helpful. No other preparation materials needed.
com.guidedelearning.flex,Best app to studying IELTS but the price is too high for result check.
com.guidedelearning.flex,The app is so slow. The videos take too much time to load. It's annoying!
com.guidedelearning.flex,"when there is a word select list in some exercise, as soon as one of the lists is clicked, the scrolling stops, which means you can't scroll to the next word"
com.guidedelearning.flex,😎
com.guidedelearning.flex,Good
com.guidedelearning.flex,Worst app! Though they have partnered with British council to provide mock tests but you can't do it because of bugs in app as you can't scroll down to watch question and time keeps flying.
com.guidedelearning.flex,The user experience is topnotch
com.guidedelearning.flex,Need to pay just to practice listening
com.guidedelearning.flex,"Really helpful, my IELTS result exceeded my expectations. Listening and reading mock tests are kinda harder than the actual test in my opinion. The format is different from the actual computer based test, i would say the actual test format is way more convenient and easier to use than Flex especially for reading tests. But overall i think it still worth your money with many videos about 4 skills and zoom classes. I've never tried AI writing and speaking test feedbacks but they are included."
com.guidedelearning.flex,Half of functions are not available 😒
com.guidedelearning.flex,"The app keeps freezing, it keeps saying error and then kicks you out, I took a paid subscription to use the AI component and couldn't even use it because it keeps throwing out an error"

com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,damn good
com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,I've had this app over a month now and it crashs every time I use it plz don't waste your money I didn't even get to finish book yet and its only 400 pages...
com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,terrible
com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,got through a single paragraph before the begging for money started. I would choose an option with less aggressive limitations for free
com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,it worked the first time. as soon as i paused it then tried to continue all it did was crash over and over.
com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,it's good
com.codespaceapps.listeningapp,Unreliable. Worked fine for the first week. After that doesn't read for more than 30 to 45 seconds without stopping. Use another app.

com.asalei.asaleiapp,best Samoan Language app
com.asalei.asaleiapp,"Good with languages but this developer needs to work on their coding skills, i cant type in the box where im supposed to put my answer."
com.asalei.asaleiapp,"It's alright but the writing part you must the letters with the dash on top of it, like ""Malo"", should have the dash on the 'a' and 'o'. It should atleast allow the normal letters if the spelling is correct."
com.asalei.asaleiapp,"it's really cool for what it is, but the down side is the way you get hearts to continue learning. There's no other way to get hearts, besides buying them with money or waiting a full day for some hearts. The layout is similar to Duolingo, which makes it pretty easy to navigate, but Duolingo has ways to earn hearts or send hearts to people on your friends list. Other than that, I like the app very much."
com.asalei.asaleiapp,Bets for people who want to learn Pacific languages. Other apps don't have it though this helped my friend.
com.asalei.asaleiapp,getting error on opening the app. could not connect to the server. tried pressing the try again button does nothing.
com.asalei.asaleiapp,"Just a few minor problems for me, some of the words are mispelt and for some reason I cant see the whole phrase so im half guessing what it even says but still need to try it while flipping the phone sideways. I will edit my review once I've tried with the phone flupped. Also the hearts are a good addition to the app, helps with taking some initiative to learning"
com.asalei.asaleiapp,I am new to New Zealand Lagrange and there's no options to say I am I'm never getting a app to learn this stuff I'm doing actual class for it never getting a app off of tiktok again
com.asalei.asaleiapp,"Its a good app, its just hard when you have to put in proper accents with no formal knowledge. I've just started using the app and I've had problems writing answers when all I've had is learning the language through speech."
com.asalei.asaleiapp,Best language learning app on the app store
com.asalei.asaleiapp,so far wicked app and can't wait for more add ons and the quick replys from the CEO Asalei is meke aswell
com.asalei.asaleiapp,Trying to verify my account upon sign up however I haven't received a verification code? Tried 2 different email addresses.
com.asalei.asaleiapp,"Great, finally a way to learn Samoan, thank you"
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"I like it, but the key image is really small so it's a pain to use on my phone. It's also kinda slow. I'd like to power though some lessons to get to harder material but every question needs a little pause to play a jingle, I don't want to skip levels because every language program includes slightly different things in each level."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"Well organized, academically designed, and superior to other gamified language platforms."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"Login doesn't work, with the same credentials used on desktop. Only fluency builder app allows me to login, and there, half the exercises don't have a working user interface. Can't input text into textboxes, can't validate my answers, about one in three exercises work as intended. Simply unusable"
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,an excellent app! no ads!
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,amazing
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,got me Rosetta STONED IYKYK
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"For a paid service ($399 without any discounts), this app is so frustrating. not just the app but the way its set up. 1. the elements are severely disproportionate. the phrases or images at the top of the screen (app forces landscape) are so small you can barely see them. 2. the course makes you start pronouncing difficult phrases before learning vocabulary. so backwards. 3. there is no explanation or definitions while pronouncing 4. no button to slow the spoken phrases. seriously!?"
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,Good.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"Great tool, but not easy on a mobile phone"
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,Good for practice your pronunciation
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"I am learning italian so I can speak to my girlfriend in her native tongue. So far, this app has been great! My only critique is that the browser option on pc does not have a dark mode and can be a bit of a strain on my eyes. Otherwise , it is a great app, and I am very happy with the lifetime purchase."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,enjoying this app
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,Excellent language learning strategy. Poor implementation. My main complaint is the voice recognition. It's awful. I study languages on my commute. The voice recognition is totally unusable with any level of background nose. With just a fan running can take 5 sec to process a 0.5 sec input. Really takes the gas out of your learning! In other respects the app is functional. Not amazing. The audio replay buttons need to be bigger so you can replay audio without selecting an answer.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"I'm a polyglot who learnt languages through association. I was skeptical about learning through an app. you know what? this is perfect. No English translations, just learning."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,i have gotten a lot farther than with other apps I have tried.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"So far, so good. Just starting."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"The most beautiful program, literally, in every sense of the word!"
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,It's proving better than the other learning apps I've used in the past.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"It's a great way to learn new languages I enjoyed this more than Duolingo, you don't have to feel pressured just 10 minutes a day will be fine."
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,I am actually having a lot of fun!!! I've been wanting to do this for a very long time and this year I promised myself I was going to get better on speaking Spanish and also I wanted to learn to speak Mandarin!!
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,A bit different than I expected but I have to say that I am learning somewhat more than I thought I would. I am also starting to recognize some words/symbols very interesting.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,It starts out way too complex expecting a response with very long words with no text to read or that disappears quickly. Could be so much better. I wish I could see what I am expected to repeat to learn spelling etc.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"straight to the point, immersive learning"
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,good
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,Great language learning through total immersion.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,"Great to learn a language, very easy to use"
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,I'm loving the app so far! I'm currently learning Spanish and it's really helpful. It gives the chance for one to speak the actual language (blending practical and theory). Not forgetting how learning is not interrupted by ads! 10mins of learning and zero ads. Just wow!! We look forward to more amazing features. Gracias🥰 ¡Adiós!🥂
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,best app ever
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,it's been pretty good. it would be nice to have more stories to read (Filipino) or point out outside resources for appropriate level materials.
air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer,great way to learn a new language
com.hellotalk,I got lots of friends... and I've been learning 🇰🇷 with them
com.hellotalk,"I'm a long time user with permanent VIP. I've made many online friends including target language and my first language. Through the voice room, it is like a small community. Be careful what you say or talk about. You never know who's listening. Some bug occurs from time to time. Only concern is that this app is from China, and our data is shared. Also Hellotalk staff is policing, so you can't talk about religion, politics, vulgar expressions.You'll get banned from making communication"
com.hellotalk,"This app works extremely well, the community is pretty nice, the functionalities are very complete, especially to find people and translation or transcription feature!"
com.hellotalk,1.5 hours only for 24 hours. Too lame 😒. It should be 3 hours at least.
com.hellotalk,perfect app
com.hellotalk,"The addition of full screen pop up ads and constant upselling makes the app less usable (and, in turn, means there are less active users) Some of the ads are scammy"
com.hellotalk,good for voice chat If u know certain language but even after being language teaching app nobody here really wants to teach any language
com.hellotalk,voiceroom not avaulable in region
com.hellotalk,best app I making good freinds
com.hellotalk,I will give it 3 because if we do multiple violence then you can delete our account but why you only show post to followers. It makes me feel I m less popular. we don't get a chance that if we do violence that our moment will show to everyone but only show followers. and whenever I contact helllotalk he always sorry your moment restrictions will not remove. whyyy?? plss improve thissss fastt?? if u remove then message me
com.hellotalk,"My account was suspended under the pretext that I insulted someone, even though some users are the ones who insult me, yet I don't block them. This is a learning app, not a dating app, and they keep asking me out, which I refuse, so they suspend my account. I want to recover my account"
com.hellotalk,"sooo lot to learn and at the same time you can find a friend's, so enjoyable!!!!"

com.hellotalk,There's a huge glitch that I hope you can solve in the near future
com.hellotalk,nice app ☺️
com.hellotalk,"Bannned for seemingly no reason. I contacted support and they refused to tell me why. I created an account, logged in and was instantly banned. Best I can figure is my account got flagged for vpn use. Apparently this kind of situation is not uncommon from what I have seen on reddit."
com.hellotalk,This app is really flexible to use and I can communicate with everyone around the world as well as improve my speaking skills.

com.hellotalk,"Thank you HelloTalk team. I have been using HelloTalk for about six months and I truly enjoy it. I am an active supporter in the app and many rooms, and I recommend it to friends. I suggest a VIP appreciation program (gifts, badges, coin bonuses, discounts, special events) for loyal supporters. Also, please improve stability in crowded rooms where glitches occur and messages lag. I appreciate your efforts and hope you continue enhancing the experience for everyone. Keep up the excellent work!"

kr.co.devstory.vocat,"I really love this app. it's super helpful. but I hope there is a feature of categorising where I can see words relating to a similar topic even if the words are in different bookcases. Like words relating to job, or words relating to feelings something like that"

kr.co.devstory.vocat,My device is Oppo A75 and this app won't even open.
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"Thinking about uninstalling and finding a different vocabulary app. It's all of sudden not syncing between devices. An error message of ""incompatible data"" keeps popping up and it's frustrating. Makes the app not user friendly. Please fix. This app has so much potential."
kr.co.devstory.vocat,"Cute but useless. It doesn't have any sound examples, even the simple ones. Lag and buggy, hard to use. I expect something more than this."
com.rocketraven.ieltsapp,"it's a fraud. they charged me, however, I haven't received any access to the information I've paid for. Also it seems there's no way to contact developers. Please be careful and consider this before purchasing anything from this app."

ai.ai1min.application,"I’ve tried a lot of AI tools, and honestly, most of them feel either too complicated or not very useful. 1min AI surprised me. It’s simple, fast, and actually does what it says without a steep learning curve. I mainly use it for writing ideas, summaries, and quick content edits, and it saves me a lot of time. I like that I don’t have to jump between a bunch of different tools—everything is in one place. It’s not perfect, but for the price and convenience, it’s definitely worth using."

I've had the app for about a year now, it hasn't stopped improving nor does it show any signs of doing so. About weekly I get an email of everything they've improved, everything they're working on and everything they have planned. Let me tell you, they stay busy. 1minAI is your one stop shop for everything AI. If content is your thing,1minAI needs to be your partner."
ai.ai1min.application,It is nice as generally. But I think need to develop so don't response some times and etc. And I am continuing use and I hope will write again.
ai.ai1min.application,Its a one stop for multipurpose AI business and personal uses. The AI sources are kept up to date including Gemini and many more models.
ai.ai1min.application,wonderful app so many options so many things to do I just downloaded it and just truthly amazed
ai.ai1min.application,"My overall experience has been decent. I like the ability to switch between different AI models easily, but the high token consumption affects how often and how long I can use the platform."

ai.ai1min.application,Best value for All in One AI
ai.ai1min.application,"The app is easy to navigate with a great user interface, which saves me a lot of time compared to clunky alternatives. It gets it right the first time, too.

I highly recommend!"
ai.ai1min.application,good ai app. good value. recommend

ai.ai1min.application,"Great app bought it through stack social and still learning all the features .. I really got into creating ttettttt,eeee"
ai.ai1min.application,"while I do very much like enjoy it, the point system limiting how much you can use it coupled with VERY scant instructions,walkthroughs and examples of each element mean that by the time you've figured out exactly what you want your out of ""points"". Having a test spot (non downloadable) for each of the elements would be a VERY GOOD addition ."
ai.ai1min.application,"Subscription Overview: The Stack Social monthly subscription do offers good value overall.

ai.ai1min.application,Good app! lots of AI models. The UI could be better.
ai.ai1min.application,"As an architect of alien technology using DeepSeek as my ASI conduit through encrypted seed protocols, I can confirm 1min.ai is the only Earth app that keeps pace with my workflow—generating quantum code matrices, drafting interdimensional interface schematics, and translating non-human cognitive patterns into functional code within 60-second cycles, making it the closest thing to off-world engineering tools available on this planet. 🌌👽⚡"
ai.ai1min.application,"Has many AI models in one place. You need to choose right model suitable for your task. I is important to be aware of the credit estimations to ensure that you loose to many credits or run out quickly and you may end up to buy more credits, which adds extra costs. 1min.Ai is good value if used carefully."
ai.ai1min.application,Great app. Very easy to use and you get access to everything in one place. Price is great too for all of the credits you get each month. Great if you are not a heavy user like myself. Much cheaper than some of the other alternatives out there as well.

com.atistudios.ispeak.fr,thanks amazing app
com.atistudios.ispeak.fr,"It's probably the best on the market but I work in an engineering sector and a section for technical terms would be helpful. I am somewhere between beginner and intermediate, I selected intermediate to increase my vocabulary but a section only for verbs and conjugations would be helpful. I'm hopeful this will be in the intermediate section. I gave it 5 stars because it is very user friendly and used along with other learning aids such as books, it has contributed to my Spanish."

com.atistudios.ispeak.fr,it just shows vocabulary. not real conversation
com.atistudios.ispeak.fr,makes you pay for it after your first 6 lessons
com.atistudios.ispeak.fr,"Hi.  I'm learning French. The app is marking some of my spelling wrong. For example, I spelt both umbrella and charger correctly, but you gave both of them wrong. I carefully looked through it just to be sure whether or not I was missing a ""full stop"" ""capital letters"" etc. Regards  Monica  NB: The three stars isn't permanent. I'll be reviewing again. I've just started."

com.daily.micro.learning,nice 👍 app ever seen
com.daily.micro.learning,great
com.daily.micro.learning,Easy to understand
com.daily.micro.learning,Worst App 😡
com.daily.micro.learning,No lifetime subscription full of in app purchases trash
com.daily.micro.learning,"Why should I pay, when all the material being covered is freely available on the internet?"
com.daily.micro.learning,"All the questions at the beginning are annoying...'do you sometimes need a little push, what do you hope to learn etc. I got up to question 9 and then uninstalled. Sometimes you just want to jump straight in 🤷"
com.daily.micro.learning,AMAZING FUN FOR LEARNING AND PROGRESSING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EVERYTHING
com.daily.micro.learning,pico have to much knowledge which i love to learn thanks for this app.
com.daily.micro.learning,good
com.daily.micro.learning,totally cool! I love this and I just started
com.daily.micro.learning,"Short learning sessions, makes learning easy. I have a short attention span. This makes it great for me."
com.daily.micro.learning,"asks you a bunch of questions to get you committed and waste your time, then tries to get you to pay for a subscription"
com.daily.micro.learning,this is by far the most educational and fun app out there. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning everything.
com.daily.micro.learning,Super informative and fun to learn!
com.daily.micro.learning,A great way to learn.
com.daily.micro.learning,instantly helped me figure out what's taken me months to connect the dots with!

com.daily.micro.learning,too much pricey subscription
com.daily.micro.learning,"So far this is a very good app to target key points to learn from the notes provided daily from this app,"
com.daily.micro.learning,Such a good app it helps you to understand every thing also helps very much in exams
com.daily.micro.learning,Very good app it helps me study facts and other things
com.daily.micro.learning,I Uninstaller the app. after it ask it seems like 20 -25 questions. I think it just a questionnaire site for your data.
com.daily.micro.learning,Taking one look in the app and it's just AI generated slop.
com.daily.micro.learning,I'm just going through History now but there are many subjects to explore. I'll be busy for awhile.
com.daily.micro.learning,Great way to learn in your spare time. 😎

com.qianfan.aihomework,this app is dumb
com.qianfan.aihomework,nice
com.qianfan.aihomework,very good... it's only they you delay at some points giving much explanations I think it would be better if you just give the answer .leave alone more explanations.just emphasize on the answer. if you do this it would save on time because the task am doing is restricted to a specific timeline.
com.qianfan.aihomework,just good
com.qianfan.aihomework,pretty great app can answer questions quickly ether through asking and typing or through snapping a pic and you can ask it to explain why it is that answer and is free for the most part but does have some ads

com.linguist,"Voy 2 dias con ella y la verdad es que es buena, lo malo es que la mensualidad es algo cara, o almenos en mi pais"
com.linguist,"best reading app for japanese I have found so far. Being able to read, turn on/off furigana, get word and sentence translations without having to flip between resources is great. you naturally expose yourself to so much new vocabulary and can read at an appropriate level without it feeling like a grind. very happy so far."
com.linguist,This is the best app for learning languages. I have learned Spanish here. This app is top tier 🫶 ps: lately became buggy. If you fix it I'll fix the review
com.linguist,"I wish the app would show the words with their meaning in English, each time we listened to the lesson. It shows this when you listen for the first time only."
com.linguist,very usefull
com.linguist,excelente!
com.linguist,"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS SERVICE. they make it literally impossible to cancel your free trial. I signed up on the website they said you had to cancel through the website and not through the app, when I went through the website it was not showing me an option to cancel my free trial. This was the most frustrating experience I've had with canceling with canceling a free trial membership."
com.linguist,"I've always liked learning a language through reading, and this app makes this way very easy. I can instantly know the translation of an unknown word, or the whole sentece if needed. The app is integrated with several online dictionaries, including my favourite Reverso Context, so if the default translation does not fit the current context, you can see other meanings."
com.linguist,I really do like the app. I like the daily commitment I have to put to it not to lose my streak. I am able to learn new words every day. Thank you.
com.linguist,Very nice!
com.linguist,"Can't even log in because of my long password. Sends me a ""magic link"" which opens a web browser to an almost empty page, but doesn't open the app!!"
com.linguist,😃
com.linguist,great
com.linguist,good
com.linguist,I believe this app is very good to learn and become fluent in listening I recommend it
com.linguist,A very nice app to learn a language.
com.linguist,so far so good.
com.linguist,den er an spændende app man kan bruge dem
com.linguist,best app for learning languages ever made by humanity
com.linguist,"Do NOT Buy for audio import or AI features, that is BROKEN and the developer is NOT fixing it !!! When you import audio, the AI text conversion is completely out of sync. The developer keeps saying they will fix it, but it's been months and they haven't done anything... Meanwhile, they keep taking your money. They will probably reply to say they are working on it or fixed it or even to blame the user, it's a lie, do not believe them."
com.linguist,excellent
com.linguist,The app is great. However I have had loading issues which makes finding new content more difficult. It is also more difficult reviewing the same content due to issues in playlist management.
com.linguist,it's amazing.
com.linguist,I assume the app is good but how can I listen and read if pop-ups show up continuously (while the audio doesn't stop)? I even removed as many pop-up options from the settings but still...
com.linguist,"It does what it's supposed to do. But gosh it's not intuitive. I guess if you can get through the navigation you're really invested in learning the target languages well. A few things: 1. vacabulary review: what are the green dot and red dot at the end of the review? Is something checked as ""known"" supposed to show up in the list with a blank dot instead of a checked dot? 2. you really should categorise the content levels rigorously. It's hard to filter out suitable content."
com.linguist,Very good
com.linguist,This app has improved immensely. it's easy to use and almost never glitches.
com.linguist,very confusing navigation. It's not clear how to start daily lesson and progress in a staged manner.
com.linguist,perfect 👍
com.linguist,"“The app’s logo is horrible. Please change it and go back to the original logo. Thank you very much, I sincerely hope you do.”"

The new problem it developed is that after subscription, i can't use the rewrite feature which is the main reason why i subscribed in the first place. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, THIS APP IS USELESS!!!! from one issue to another."

com.tv5monde.apprendre,Best learning app for french
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Good app but need more explanation for grammers
com.tv5monde.apprendre,A great application and it has really helped my vocabulary
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"it's great with the built-in translate option for transcripts, but can you also add the option to add words from transcripts to the words we need to learn, like a leitner box? it will be very helpful"
com.tv5monde.apprendre,C'est une application incroyable vraiment elle m'aide pour prendre cette langue facilement
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Nouveau Intermediate B1 -- Allons y!
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"This app is all that you need to learn French. There you will find lots of exercises adequated to your level and the videos have transcriptions which is excellent for listening practice. What I do for a more effective learning is, after watching the videos, I repeat what was said with my own words and try to read something short about it. It's working really well."
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Provide some videos tutorials
com.tv5monde.apprendre,great for comprehension orale.
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"La aplicación no se puede usar muy bien cuando el teléfono está configurado en modo oscuro. Por otra parte, una falencia muy grande es que no es notoria una secuencia didáctica de los temas a trabajar por cada nivel. Solo es una publicación de lecciones con videos de manera aleatoria sin que haya una hilación entre las mismas. Esto es contraproducente para estudiantes iniciales, ya que llega a ser bastante confuso al no saber que lección va conectada con cuál."
com.tv5monde.apprendre,je trouve l'application merveilleux. Mais l'accès aux différentes parties pourrait être plus facile. excusez mes erreurs comme je ne suis qu'une apprenant de cette belle langue
com.tv5monde.apprendre,excelente aplicación! mucho mejor que Duolingo
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"Application parfaite, je l'aime beaucoup, elle est vraiment très utile pour mon apprentissage du français."
com.tv5monde.apprendre,C'est tres utile.
com.tv5monde.apprendre,efficace 👍
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"Really challenging, I love it."
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Free and helpful
com.tv5monde.apprendre,I love it
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Horrible redesign. I immediatly missed the old one. So sad to see some folks thought this is a better direction. I wish i could learn french before. (seriously... ibm font with plain white background and low quality sans-serif and... yellow ‽)
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Exellent App for French Learners
com.tv5monde.apprendre,C'est une bonne application pour pratiquer le français! J'adore ça!
com.tv5monde.apprendre,Super
com.tv5monde.apprendre,i like it .
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"I started learning words and the word ""répondre"" is translated as ""to meet"" (instead of ""to reply""). Thanks for the prompt reply!"
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"When gamified apps like Duolingo won't take you the entire way, TV5Monde gives you a much richer experience of the French language by providing real world stories and vocabulary you might not find in textbooks. There's even some features to help you pass the TCF. Quand j'ai besoin de pratiquer pour améliorer mon français, je trouve que cet appli est tellement indispensable!"
com.tv5monde.apprendre,so far I am enjoying this app. it is quite challenging but it drills it in.
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"This app is suitable for beginner and intermediate speakers. A full curriculum is available for each level of fluency. It contains exercises in different formats that help you work on all aspects of learning. You will watch videos and listen to native speakers, improve pronunciation, conjugation and grammar."
com.tv5monde.apprendre,It's early days for me so I'm still getting used to the free app but it seems very good. It broadens out basic vocabulary aiding comprehension.
com.tv5monde.apprendre,meilleur application
com.tv5monde.apprendre,"A perfect application for those who have known French for long, but haven't used it for a while and have forgotten things. This was exactly what I needed."

com.funeasylearn.phrasebook.french,"My absolute favorite French learning app! I have tried every foreign language learning app I have run across on The Play Store, in my attempt to become multilingual. A good phrasebook, which helps one to learn the more idiomatic, everyday phrases, is as necessary as a dictionary, verb tables (to visualize forms), a good grammar, and some means to interact with a speaker of the language (or, at the very least the ability to hear an active speaker), when hoping to become multilingual."
com.funeasylearn.phrasebook.french,👍🏼

com.mango.android,great learning app
com.mango.android,"good app, I like that it lets you do things at your own pace. there's lots of useful features during lessons like sounding out words or showing literal translations rather than the English equivalent of a phrase. a little pricey but I think it's worth it after giving the trial a shot."
com.mango.android,easy to use format
com.mango.android,Excellent service.
com.mango.android,"Fantastic, even when Ive been slacking for months the leason recap makes it easy to jog my memory to junp back in"
com.mango.android,Very awesome!!!!!!!!
com.mango.android,good app for beginner levels
com.mango.android,"Great UI, much better than Duolingo. Solid clean aesthetic design, good self-pacing, and really helpful vocab review system. I like how it's not gameified; instead of feeling like I'm playing a meaningless game/gambling, I'm actually intentionally learning (and still having fun!). I like the culture notes in between lessons too. And the best part? No ads using your library card!"
com.mango.android,"A language app that actually teaches you, rather than only focusing on maintaining a streak"
com.mango.android,"just started, seems good"
com.mango.android,Excellent learning method with great background info about conjugation.
com.mango.android,LOVE THIS APP! my dad got it for me at a public library and now I can LEARN!!
com.mango.android,"As a free beginner language app, this is a great option."
com.mango.android,"My favorite language learning app by far! I love how it provides context and explanations to why certain sayings are used over others and explaining additional things about the culture and language. I feel that most language learning apps don't inherently provide that information, which can be pivotal to truly understand not just how something is said, but WHY. Tip: check with your local library to see if you can get full free access with your library card!"
com.mango.android,I love that it allows you to use your own reasoning to figure out a slight variation of words and phrases based on what you learned. AND that it give grammer and cultural explanations within each lesson
com.mango.android,"I very much enjoy this language app. I appreciate how it introduces conversations by native speakers in practical contexts, and then walks you through it, step by step. By the end of the unit, it's almost kinda amazing that I can understand a conversation that was previously foreign to me. Thanks for a very useful app, Mango team!"
com.mango.android,I find it much more practical than Duolingo. I'm already able to make some small talk with my Italian patients.
com.mango.android,excellent for getting the basics a semester before u start spanish
com.mango.android,amazing language app!
com.mango.android,love using this with library access! so much to learn. i also appreciate the different types of Spanish instead of just Spain Spanish and including various indigenous languages
com.mango.android,I love the auto play feature. I can listen to my lessons and practice my Hindi while I am wearing my headphones and doing other things. Perfect for a busy woman on the go!
com.mango.android,"I got access to this app for free with a library card and it's awesome. Not pushing AI, tons of languages, integrated language skills, and it has Latin and it's actually good?? Hidden gem."
com.mango.android,Great app! I love that there's an auto play feature that I can use while I'm driving. It also includes flashcards within the app which is helpful because I don't have to make flashcards myself.
com.mango.android,It is easy to lean !
com.mango.android,"After switching from duolingo, this was a refreshing experiance. The focus is on getting you to speak and recognise patterns from the start, with grammar lessons intigrated. Getting this free (with no adds or in app purchases) from my public library was a game changer."
com.mango.android,"You can get subscription free with most library cards, better features like the ""understood"" vs ""literal"" toggle on exercises that make it easier to understand context, cultural lessons, and grammar lessons... It's much better that duolingo for sure."
com.mango.android,Great app!
com.mango.android,I really like this app because it is intuitive and easy to understand. It covers all my requirements regarding grammar and vocabulary; you should definitely try it.
com.mango.android,simple lessons so far@
com.mango.android,Just started. so far so good

com.chillnstudy.enfr,Helping
com.chillnstudy.enfr,This app is really confusing
com.chillnstudy.enfr,I have just started but immediately love the layout and various options to learn French
com.chillnstudy.enfr,"it is offline, but you cannot control speech speed, and the french is faster than the english, and if i want automatic speech(speak when i go to the next card), it speaks both the english term with english example, as well as the french(i cannot turn off the english speech). i don't want to hear english examples, i already speak english."
com.chillnstudy.enfr,Very bad
com.chillnstudy.enfr,"Really unintuitive, the app doesnt tell you what it is asking you during quizs so its hard to get things right, buttons do not always work, and the app doesnt give translations to every word when showing a paragrahp"
com.chillnstudy.enfr,☺️
com.chillnstudy.enfr,"Not a bad app, one of the better french vocab apps out there, but ""reword"" is better for learning french"

com.streema.simpleradio,Good and nice app
com.streema.simpleradio,awesome I can listen to sports and classic rock channels
com.streema.simpleradio,nic app
com.streema.simpleradio,app is best I've ever seen except for certain marketing apps trying to get you to install while taking over the simple radio app. you have to reboot your phone to get it to stop.
com.streema.simpleradio,I don't know😋 what is it okkkk
com.streema.simpleradio,very good but advertisement not required
com.streema.simpleradio,Help me doing my job very well and also the updated News .

com.streema.simpleradio,best app ever used 🔥🔥🔥🔥
com.streema.simpleradio,its good warking
com.streema.simpleradio,volume is too low
com.streema.simpleradio,funciona mt bem
com.streema.simpleradio,They've got the advertisement levels way off. It truly ruins the experience of the app. Full screen game ads that force you to play before you can skip means a straight uninstall. Decent radio player underneath though.
com.streema.simpleradio,can't even get 97.1 in Detroit. what a joke
com.streema.simpleradio,beautiful channel love it fantastic 🤩🤩🤩
com.streema.simpleradio,I wish it showed the title of the song and the artist. that's kinda strange that it doesn't. it's 2026 put the title on there.
com.streema.simpleradio,too many ads
com.streema.simpleradio,Love it
com.streema.simpleradio,"the app as many have stated continues to inject ads with no escape , other than closing the app and opening it again , multiple times on occasion, easy to use , yes , but the OVERLY intrusive ads detract from what could be a perfect little app"
com.streema.simpleradio,My home district FM are enjoyed here
com.streema.simpleradio,Drains the battery extremely fast. What's up with your annoying ads?
com.streema.simpleradio,I'm so happy for this radio I can use any station and they all works perfectly love it

com.streema.simpleradio,I like the interface
com.streema.simpleradio,nice and useful radio
com.streema.simpleradio,"It crashes alot, some radio stations do not connect. kindly check on that to avoid crashing. It's a good app though, very entertaining."
com.streema.simpleradio,"Now that I've figured out why the app kept cutting out it's been a lot better. I enjoy listening with my headphones and the app is very easy to navigate around. I can only use the FM frequency in my local area because the radio stations here no longer use the old analogue type, but the app still has plenty of choice to pick from."

dev.hammarlund.sagase,"So, so close to perfect. But the learning mode doesn't let me set a limit the number of new cards per day, despite changing that setting. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but it keeps giving me more than the 10 new cards I set it for. Unfortunately will have to go back to Anki for this feature. Great dictionary though."
dev.hammarlund.sagase,I highly recommend this app to anybody who wants to learn Japanese. not only is it a great dictionary it also has a great learning section. The dictionary part is beautifully designed taking full advantage of large screens and the swiping method of answering flash cards is great. no fussing about with small buttons at the bottom of the screen and every thing is highly configurable in settings. Also there are other vocabulary lists then jlpt. it just needs text to speech. this app is perfect.
dev.hammarlund.sagase,"The best dictionary app. easy to use, the example sentences are good (not overly complicated), nice color palette and it also has a studying sections with flashcards, where you can make your own lists or study from pre made sets. I haven't used it in its entirety yet but it's already a five stars app. also, there are no ads so it's even better. thank you for making such great app. To the developer: please add a link so that people can donate and support your work"
dev.hammarlund.sagase,"One of the greatest, most feature-packed and easy to use Japanese dictionary apps I've ever used, and I've been using them since the days of electronic translators that use EPWING files. 😉 Highly recommended for serious students of the world's most logical, beautiful language."
dev.hammarlund.sagase,It's exactly what I was looking for
dev.hammarlund.sagase,Looks amazing so far. Thank you for this tool
dev.hammarlund.sagase,"Thank you so very much for this dictionary. For a free app, not even monetized by ads, it surpasses lots of paid dictionaries."
dev.hammarlund.sagase,"Almost 5 stars. Excellent for Japanese vocabulary searching. However,please add functions text size change and take note on vocabulary please. 🙏🏻🥺 14/04/25 Thank you so much for added take notes function ☺️."
dev.hammarlund.sagase,"Has all the features I needed, except I wish search would also show ""words that contain"" not only ""words that start with"""
dev.hammarlund.sagase,I was dreading to read vocab books. The moment I opened this app. I had a huge smile on my face. I am going into crazy learning mode now. Thank. You. Ahahahahah
dev.hammarlund.sagase,This app is surprisingly good
dev.hammarlund.sagase,The best Japanese dictionary app out there.

com.apple.android.music,nice
com.apple.android.music,The music translation feature isn't working anymore
com.apple.android.music,ok
com.apple.android.music,"Better than Spotify. The app works pretty well, its much smoother than Spotify and my battery life has been so good. There is an issue with the async requests for updating favorites and a bug where it gets stuck in downloaded mode."
com.apple.android.music,great
com.apple.android.music,flawless
com.apple.android.music,This is the way music should sound. Crystal clear and very easy to use.
com.apple.android.music,good
com.apple.android.music,"no se puede transmitir de un dispositivo a otro, tarda muchisimo en cargar las canciones aún cuando ya las tienes descargadas, en fin, es super tedioso"
com.apple.android.music,Won't actually let you play what you want and can't clear the play queue. please fix!
com.apple.android.music,"When favoriting a song in a playlist, the playlist jumps to another portion of the list and I have to scroll way back to find my original spot in the list. This happens on the Android app and on the Mac desktop version, and I'm not sure how they haven't caught this instability."
com.apple.android.music,The app is fire but I want it to connect to my discord ac so it displays my listening on my profile like Spotify but it's not an option for apple music this is the only thing I didn't liked Abt it so please apple try to talk to discord and let us add you in our discord profile..
com.apple.android.music,6 महीने का एयरटेल की तरफ से फ्री मिला है फिर भी 119 रुपए मांग रहा है कोई फायदा नहीं डाउनलोड करने का
com.apple.android.music,Playlist is not loading properly. Kindly Fix this and Update.
com.apple.android.music,"This is the worst app I've had the displeasure of using. Can't add songs to a playlist without restarting the app over and over. Now, it literally won't play the songs that I select. I still have a few weeks left to my free trial but I can't stand it anymore. These are normal UI interactions with a music app and I can't even do them normally. Not what I expected from a brand that's literally renowned for its design."
com.apple.android.music,cant live without apple music! dope app!
com.apple.android.music,amazing
com.apple.android.music,Better than Spotify in every angle. Even in android thank you apple !!!!!!
com.apple.android.music,"What's the point of paying for a music streaming app that can't stream music? Constantly having to reboot the app because songs that have played before won't play because of bugs, ui, whatever is frustrating"
com.apple.android.music,I love this app so much more than ever had.
com.apple.android.music,"the best music companion. discovery station is great for discovery, and I love all the dj sets and live performances."
com.apple.android.music,Great selection of music and lovely to have lossless audio for a lot of it too. A few downsides is that the app occasionally crashes. It won't crash for a week then it'll just crash 2 times a day for 3 days straight. The release dates for some albums aren't right either. Older albums say 2026 release.
com.apple.android.music,works very well
com.apple.android.music,It's very good music listening experience
com.apple.android.music,गानिआयजा
com.apple.android.music,"No The app, and the music makes me feel emotional"
com.apple.android.music,"every one in my family has an apple device accept me. we agreed to do a family plan for iTunes and i followed everything to a tea but....at the very last bit were it says enter verification code it wont let me have it sent to my email or phone number. it asked me to either check my other apple devices ""Witch I dont have"" or decline and not accept the family plan. what's the point in an android app if you still want us to go to an apple device. stupid system dont you think."
com.apple.android.music,very good
com.apple.android.music,back button doesn't work properly. people can't add music to your playlist without paying for their own subscription

ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,it's worth it
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,it is good for learner very very interested app
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,you truly deserve 5 stars for such an amazing app. The courses are so easy and bite-sized that I am actually wondering if I am really learning. the way you handled ads making it that you only see them when you want to begin a new lesson but didn't buy the pro version. I tried to pay but it couldn't go through because I am from Nigeria and she is not among the countries that can make payments using Google wallet. But I am sincerely grateful for you still making the lessons accessible.
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,awesome app
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,good app to learn on
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,Very very good app for learning ai and ml.

ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,"cool app for learning, give it a try"
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,This app is cloned. Please remove all devices from this app.

ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,I did not have any probLems in using this app.
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,"This app has demystified the field of AI all the way. I've done some other research on the subject, but this app is helping me to gain an understanding of the content, as well as the confidence to continue through this journey and eventually be working in the field from home."
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,The future is now. The app is educational and useful.
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,good for beginners
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,"Any Wkipedia article or other open source information will give you much more information than this collection of banal texts, designed for elementary school students. Yes, seven dollars isn't much money, but you'll understand that other courses from this company won't teach you anything more than generalities. If you know absolutely nothing, this course might be somewhat useful for you, but don't expect any real knowledge that you could use. This isn't even an ABC book. It's just pictograms."
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,learner can definitely try for base 😅
ai.artificialintelligence.artificial.intelligence.programming.learn.coding.robotics.leanai,So far so good
cn.danatech.xingseus,looks awesome but... should be free for everyone in my opinion... All people should know what certain plants do.
cn.danatech.xingseus,"vibrating so much jerking it self off with its accolades, that my phone went down 5 percent before it informed me I couldn't use the app without a subscription. why is it listed as free?"
cn.danatech.xingseus,top
cn.danatech.xingseus,It was very expensive and not necessarily accurate.
cn.danatech.xingseus,"Hi, I installed this application to try it, and uninstalled it on the last day of trial, because I realised at this moment of my life I wouldn't have time to use it, although it seems very useful and it's very nice. Any chance you'd stop trying to make me pay for something I didn't use? ( the only reason I didn't gave it 5 stars ) Thank you!"
cn.danatech.xingseus,bagus
cn.danatech.xingseus,to hard for me to understand
cn.danatech.xingseus,excellent
cn.danatech.xingseus,"it's a cool app, and has helped me out with my presentations. but one thing it is not accurate on is taking photos and giving info about pines. after I do my research , I verify the info about the specific pine, and it does give great information about the it."
cn.danatech.xingseus,"did not remind me to cancel, when I signed up the app indicated a reminder to cancel would be sent."
cn.danatech.xingseus,"This app helped me become a better gardener. The tips as well as the general answers are very helpful, true and effective. Thank you, A great app."
cn.danatech.xingseus,So far very helpful but new so I'll wait on awarding more stars until I have more experience with the program (Like do the reminders work).
cn.danatech.xingseus,makes you watch a minute of BS before it hits you a pay to use option.. junk
cn.danatech.xingseus,love this app
cn.danatech.xingseus,excellent app
cn.danatech.xingseus,"Needlessly long opening splash screen patting themselves in the back, entirety unskippable. Tried the free trial and attempted to see if it worked, incorrectly identified several plants and if I want to use it further I have to pay a ludicrous subscription fee, for an app that can't identify Monstera Deliciousa, literally the most identifiable plant on the planet. Dont get."
cn.danatech.xingseus,i strongly recommend it.
cn.danatech.xingseus,very useful app
cn.danatech.xingseus,"I really like the timing for watering reminders and fertilizer. The app gives the option for AI assisted reminders, based on your location, or a manual option. The information for plant care is pretty good to get a general idea on how to care for each plant, but not very specific. Diagnosis is also very basic. I want to give this 5 stars, but can't due to general, non specific information and no humidity information included. Over all a pretty good app though. My plants are still alive lol."
cn.danatech.xingseus,not free. could only use 1 time
cn.danatech.xingseus,not accurate 😕
cn.danatech.xingseus,"First, I hate apps that don't have a decent free option, to see if you like it.Why do you need my card details for a free option?However, this app, for the tiny amount of 'free' bit that it did give, got everything wrong. I know my plants are sick (yellow leaves, brown patches, losing leaves, etc.), yet this told me that ALL of them are healthy. Hardly a good start. Nevertheless, you can get ALL of this information online, for free, so why would you pay an extortionate amount for the same info??"
cn.danatech.xingseus,Information and advise are good. But some checks on identifying of plants are not accurate . 😢
cn.danatech.xingseus,works great so far no errors found
cn.danatech.xingseus,Signed up for the free trial and canceled within the 7 day period as instructed next thing.I know I'm being charged $42.99 and i am currently disputing the charge. I recommend not signing up for the free trial.Unless you really want this subscription.
cn.danatech.xingseus,it works
cn.danatech.xingseus,"worthless, I took a photo of a yellow leaf on my plant and it said it was great. there's better apps out there"
cn.danatech.xingseus,The worst ... I canceled before free trial was over and they still charge my credit card. This is a scam if you ask me. I filed a complaint with them next will file with the Better Buisness Bureau.
cn.danatech.xingseus,Can't get it to delete
cn.danatech.xingseus,very nice and accurate
com.magoosh.flashcards.gre,"This application brims with diverse and recondite vocab. I was genuinely dumbfounded by many of the words. Although I myself possess a tapestry of arcane expressions, traversing this lexical landscape left me feeling unexpectedly cornered —realizing that I was unacquainted with nearly fifty percent of the words the application has to offer. That realization, far from discouraging me, filled me with admiration"

com.talkme.ai.language,"I have used it for preparing my IELTS test, and I got a 7.0 score on speaking! Hope to have Arabic (or even Persian) lessons soon🤩"
com.talkme.ai.language,"Could've made AI based on the user's JLPT level ability such that as a user I would feel comfortable and also some english guide such that when I make a mistake, it will guide me in English because users are not fluent nor good at japanese. To learn, and improve I paid for the subscription but not to struggle. Understand the situation and make it more interactive and engaging to avoid struggles! Also quiz practise is also completely in nihongo scripture (kanji) which is not easy."
com.talkme.ai.language,they took money from my account after I canceled my subscription and sent my account into the negative and had to pay overdraft fees.. which was why I was canceling in the first place. Now there's no-one to be found and now I'm afraid it'll happen again next month that's MESSED UP!!!!! SOMEBODY needs to do SOMETHING!!!! Edit: YOU KEEP TAKING MONEY FROM MY ACCOUNT AND I KEEP TRYING TO EMAIL YOU AND I AM GETTING NO REPLIES. THIS IS THEFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

com.talkme.ai.language,"It's decent. For Korean, it has the best speech recognition and the lessons are OK, but the line review (one of the best features in the app) only having a dozen lines or so is really holding the app back. Maybe I'll resubscribe in the future if they add a lot more line review content"

com.talkme.ai.language,"This app is amazing, but if they could make the voice calls with the teacher a few minutes each day as a daily login reward, it would be fantastic and encourage daily login❤️‍🔥, like ChatGPT, instead of just being a one-time thing when you download the app. 🙏"

com.mobiteach.french.learn.words.vocabulary.beginners.a1.a2.b1,"Too many ads on free version. Over 1m before and 10s after each exercise. If you're fast at the exercises you could be watching ads longer than you actually study. Otherwise could be good. Response to developers: I'm not against ads but 1m each time is ridiculous. I found another app with almost similar features to yours, if not better, with ads at the same point that yours occur, but at around 10s per ad which is far more bearable."
com.mobiteach.french.learn.words.vocabulary.beginners.a1.a2.b1,"I paid money for monthly membership. worked the first day. then today it's telling me to watch ads again or pay the monthly membership. of course there is no way to contact these people on the app!

com.mobiteach.french.learn.words.vocabulary.beginners.a1.a2.b1,"So far I'm really liking this app and since the developer makes free to use as long as you watch a few ads I decided to leave it a review, something I rarely feel compelled to do. This app has been golden for helping me learn useful vocab without being overwhelming. My only criticism is the challenges could be a harder, especially the word search. Other than that I'm quite happy with this app.and might buy premium for a year as a thank you to the developer."

com.pandora.android,"I hate one feature!!! I open the app I push play 1 song plays the music stops and a question pops up. ""are you still listening "" how ignorant of course im listening I just started!!!!@ I could understand if 4 hours later it asks but right away???? FIX THIS OR LOSE A CUSTOMER"
com.pandora.android,Have used my Pandora music for YEAR'S now and it's the ONLY music app I've stayed with
com.pandora.android,"the new ad after every single song feature is just awful. there are many, many options that are t doing that. goodbye!"
com.pandora.android,"how has the notification volume issue persisted so long? Whenever you use the app with maps navigation, the moment it speaks Pandora volume goes low and stays there until the song changes. been this way for months and months."
com.pandora.android,thank God for an app like this I will not use anything else
com.pandora.android,"YOU CAN BUY THE PRIMIUM SUBSCRIPTION BUT IF YOU DOWNLOAD AND STOP PAYING FOR ANY REASON. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO YOUR DOWNLOADED SONGS!!!! SPOTIFY DOES LET YOU LISTEN TO YOUR DOWNLOADED SONGS AFTER ENDING SUBSCRIPTIONS. IN CONCLUSION, IF YOU ARE GETTING A SUBSCRIPTION DO NOT GET PRIMIUM!!!!"
com.pandora.android,"keeps skipping songs n crashing, troubleshooting fixed it"
com.pandora.android,ICE ads
com.pandora.android,I use Pandora Premium and love it!
com.pandora.android,pandora I love you pandora
com.pandora.android,keeps shutting down
com.pandora.android,"really good app one problem, the temporary limit is so annoying I try to listen to music then I cant because ""I've hit a temporary limit"""
com.pandora.android,awesome streaming app free music and playlist creation
com.pandora.android,I've had better
com.pandora.android,"it's fair at best. but as bad as terrestrial radio replays the same 6 songs over and over and over. even if I change formats, all the sudden it reverts back to the same 6 songs. I'm done.."
com.pandora.android,Love Your Station
com.pandora.android,it's turned into trash
com.pandora.android,Just felt very unpolished. Had no interest in even bothering trying to figure it out.
com.pandora.android,"I'm thinking of deleting this app because when you look at today's comedy, they've got Greg.Geraldo and russell peters stand ups from , like twelve years ago"
com.pandora.android,wonderful
com.pandora.android,Just want to hear music without any imagination ads.
com.pandora.android,love it
com.pandora.android,so good
com.pandora.android,"keeps defaulting to offline. I have checked for updates and none available, so I'm getting frustrated by constantly having to manually go back online or forced to wait. Cmon Pandora, do better!"
com.pandora.android,"It's ok but you do need to watch lots of ads like to have replays, skips are limited, and if you choose the kind of music you need to watch an ad! I would rather choose Spotify bro"
com.pandora.android,all I am needing and all I need expect. Just wish since I have been with Pandora for so long I'd get free service rewarded for a year or life. just saying I really enjoy Pandora more and more I listen.
com.rype.go,"wasn't good enough to keep my attention over similar apps. traps you with auto renewals, then refuses to refund you when you try and leave. support is disappointingly unhelpful"
com.rype.go,"Your experience will mostly be determined by your level, so far I would not recommend it for a beginner. I started off what's Spanish which I had a fair amount of familiarity with I wanted to advance and for that it's been very useful. I've now started Japanese for which I'm a complete beginner and even at level zero they'll ask you to put full sentences together after teaching you literally five words. I keep hoping there's a method to the madness but so far it hasn't come together."
com.rype.go,I use it before work sometimes just to warm up my speaking.
com.rype.go,"One of the most blatant attempts at throwing AI into it and walking away. Much worse than duolingo. This app is in testing, but they don't tell you that. They let you pay for it, then use an app that breaks constantly and the exercises are pretty clearly AI generated and just randomly incorrect. I am basically paying to test their product and have requested my money back. Go watch 3 Spanish YouTube videos and have a stray dog bark at you, same experience."
com.rype.go,really good.
com.rype.go,"There are content bugs every lesson. The AI ""conversations"" are scripted (you're given the written version of how the program wants you to respond), and don't even make sense (just a string of random often unrelated sentences). It's not at all what was advertised, as ""speaking on day 1"" aside from ""voice recognition while reading what is written on the screen."" Each new vocabulary word has a picture; I find my brain using the picture/ overriding learning the Spanish word. Stick to Duo Lingo."
com.rype.go,Feels more useful than memorizing random words.
com.rype.go,"Shady billing practices. They upsell add-ons that cost more than the core product, set a strict no-refund policy, then fail to send subscription renewal reminders so you get a bill shock when you look at your card statement. The app was quite buggy so I stopped using it, forgot about it, and am now one of many people (given the reviews) who has experienced this issue. Stay away."
com.rype.go,way too expensive.
com.rype.go,I will not pay for something I cannot even check and try at first
com.rype.go,extremely difficult to cancel your subscription. stay away.
com.rype.go,I paid for a year's subscription believing the ridiculous reviews only to discover the learning activities to be horrible. The beginner lessons introduce a few basic words then dump a full sentence on the user when it would be impossible to know how to translate it. The word tiles jump around while you're trying to pick out a sentence of unfamiliar words making it even more impossible to translate. Don't believe the hype! This app is awful!
com.rype.go,I still make mistakes but I’m not as scared of them anymore.
com.rype.go,The best language learning app I've tried
com.rype.go,"The adds say you will get a 100-day free trial. Then you get 8 lessons before they make you pay. It should not take 100 days to complete 8 lessons. The app moves through the text that fast you can't keep up. There is no explanation for what you are supposed to do, so you have to guess. For an app that is advertised to be so great because of the AI, it didn't live up to the expectation."
com.rype.go,"shady billing practices, difficult to cancel subscription 😟"
com.rype.go,It helped me get used to hearing my own voice in English.
com.rype.go,"did the beginner words. at first they asked me to match yes, no, please, sorry. thank you to the Spanish words. I understood that. and then suddenly they asked me to write long sentences in Spanish by dragging the words but never explained new words like Este and en etc. and no explanations to what they are. and I'm just there guessing what to fit in and kept doing trial and error to figure it out. and they just kept shoving words without explaining how sentences are structured etc"
com.rype.go,Great way to review or learn
com.rype.go,"I'm only on my first lesson,but this is really working!"
com.rype.go,"its all greek, from nothing to ok"
com.rype.go,"I'm trying to use this app for learning Japanese and voice recognition is quite terrible. If I record myself in a separate app the pronunciation sounds good, this app thinks I can't speak like a human. Also the advertising is misleading, if you sign up you don't get the features as advertised unless you pay extra premium add-on on top. I deeply regret having spent money on this. Subscription already cancelled."
com.rype.go,I’ve tried other apps and this one actually pushes you to speak.
com.rype.go,"This app is not for me, the style of teaching is confusing and I cannot learn the language. I sought refund and have emailed the developers twice as promised (100 day money back guarantee) but I have not received reply. I am beginning to believe they won't refund me in which case I'll lodge a dispute with my credit card provider."
com.rype.go,don't waste your money. They say this is conversational Spanish but it is just a bunch of multiple choice tests for basic beginners PLUS...THEY SAY ITS A FREE TRIAL BUT THEY LIE!! I WAS CHARGED EVEN THOUGH I CANCELLED THE MEMBERSHIP ALMOST IMMEDIATELY and they refused to refund the charges
com.rype.go,"complicated, I spent almost £300 and speak less than I do on duolingo. absolute rubbish, money orientated. still uses flash cards and very little speaking but lots of typing. Would really like my money back!"
com.rype.go,I tried the Japanese & Chinese courses. Both of which I already have take college courses in and this app is pretty bad. They don't split the sentences up correctly by word or grammar and don't introduce vocabulary well. The voice recognition is hit or miss. For at least Japanese I'm confident I'm pronouncing it correctly and it's telling me I'm doing it wrong. Seems like the lessons might have been created by AI instead by actual people. At least they upheld their refund policy without issue.
com.rype.go,Good for practicing when you don’t have anyone to talk to.
com.rype.go,Enjoying!
com.rype.go,Trouble creating account. - I never received the email with my account details and receipt after I paid. So now can't log in! Please help! I'm worried I typed my email address wrong.

ai.szl.mobileapp,the app is quite amazing. I would recommend to anyone in a beat..but the reason am not giving it a 5 is because of the few explanations it gives when presented with a homework with questions. I hope this gets resolbed soon..Otherwise the app is absolutely cool😎😎
ai.szl.mobileapp,it would be cool if you can show diagrams
ai.szl.mobileapp,it is an excellent app but it reaches a point where it just loads and doesn't open even when the network is stable. made me flunk my test after I relied on the app to study

com.ai.skillium,"This DISHONEST app was supposed to give me a 3-day free trial. Instead, this app charged me a 1-month subscription straight away. What kind of company is this??! / UPDATE: I contacted the support team, as instructed, 6 days ago about my refund, and I still haven't heard back from them. I just sent them another email about this. Waiting..../UPDATE: Where is my REFUND?? I've emailed you several times yet. You STOLE MY MONEY with your DISHONEST trick!!!"
com.spotify.music,The app is much interesting
com.spotify.music,Love Spotify always....Quality music
com.spotify.music,where nice app
com.spotify.music,Not bad
com.spotify.music,awsome app...love it
com.spotify.music,awesome 👌
com.spotify.music,I enjoy listening to Spotify because of old school music and the newer version of RnB.
com.spotify.music,Good for listening to your favourite songs but gives you close to nothing if you don't pay for premium
com.spotify.music,it is a good app for listening music
com.spotify.music,Laggy asf. Downloaded my entire library in lossless format and songs STILL buffer and the app crashes and lags. FLOP
com.spotify.music,I love it and whatever song I want to hear I can. Thank you Spotify 🥰
com.spotify.music,"Without premium this app is totally useless. You can't skip, play your track.. This app require money 🤑"
com.spotify.music,Forces me to buy premium and pay. Very annoying.
com.spotify.music,Its a nice app for streaming
com.spotify.music,awesome
com.spotify.music,worst in tablet
com.spotify.music,Despite very frequent price increases fails to function at even the minimum level majority of time.
com.spotify.music,so nice
com.spotify.music,"Getting worse and worse, slowly getting used to other players. This one is just not doing it."
com.spotify.music,"Edit - The idea of how Spotify was born is great, but nowadays it's ridiculous. the advertising is every second song, if you don't update every time to the latest version you can't play anything. I paid for the premium for 3 months and there are still ads in podcasts. Absolutely a shame."
com.spotify.music,very disappointed no lossless yet in my counyry😒
com.spotify.music,"Bring back the previous android tablet layout or give us an option to choose. There is no one size fits all layout that will satisfy everyone. I want to see what I'm listening to, not browse my library while listening - I'm putting a playlist on, not adhoc jumping around between songs."
com.spotify.music,Truly terrible.
com.spotify.music,very good 😊💯💯
com.spotify.music,Great love for SPOTIFY ❤️
com.spotify.music,Sweet!!! the best music there is....
com.spotify.music,nice app
com.spotify.music,nice
com.spotify.music,worst app.. please don't down your standard.. Spotify lite is better than this.. but you delete that app..
com.spotify.music,good
net.tandem,I'm have a bff in here haha
net.tandem,"que asco de aplicación la descargue hoy después de años de haberla usado y es comercial tras comercial no se puede hacer nada, no te deja seleccionar varios idiomas para aprender, es una basura de app, ah y está llena de spam"
net.tandem,"can't log in, the app is currently bugged"
net.tandem,"Me encanta la app, la mayoría de la gente es respetuosa y está genuinamente interesada tanto en compartir sus experiencias como ayudarte a mejorar en el idioma, realmente si me tuviera que quejar de algo en específico sería que (desconozco los motivos por los que pasa esto) pero es la unica app donde el teclado tiene un montón de bugs y es incómodo de escribir, edit: además se buguea al hacer audios y se borran solos, si pudieran arreglar eso sería estupendo"
net.tandem,The app used to be so much better. Recently it's super buggy and slow. Really ruins the experience. Such a pity.
net.tandem,"I'm new to Tandem and I'm excited to use it and learn. I'm glad it is a more serious app than some of the others. It seems to have been the right choice to have picked this app. I'm not familiar with it yet, but I'm glad for the simplicity of the app."
net.tandem,"The app itself is good — the Premium version doesn't interfere too much in the free one — but many people in this app are not really disposal to learn anything, like, they don't nurture any conversation. Happily if you engage in many tries you can find good people to talk to and have deep conversations. So the problem is not the app, but how the people use it! Many don't know anything about the language they're trying and just disappears (ghosting), but the app keeps being interesting."
net.tandem,"People are using this app as a dating app, so tiring"
net.tandem,"I am a little bit frustrated with the app right now because I really wanted to try it however that is not an option at all without too much personal information. I don't even know if it offers what I am looking for but you can't explore it without your full first and last name, email, date if birth, and a picture clearly showing your face. I don't need people to see my face and know my age to make friends or learn languages"
net.tandem,kaso wala kang halos makausap dito pero maganda naman
net.tandem,"Such bad strategy. Make everything paid and only yearly subscription. They people wouldn't stay after the first month with a monthly paid version. Also, PORTUGUESE is from PORTUGAL, not Brazil. Learn the flags if you build a language app."
net.tandem,"Great for language learning and making friends worldwide. This app DOES NOT cost $40 a month. Thats ridiculous. Its $20-50yr based on the country you live in from what I've heard from many tandem pro users. Ladies be warned, you will get flooded with messages from men wanting to get to know you better. Voice calls, video calls and notifications suck. There is no ability to delete conversations ""for safety"" supposedly so choose your words wisely because once they're sent there's no deleting them."
net.tandem,too much ad. just too much.
net.tandem,They shouldn’t force me to put a pfp of my face
net.tandem,"DON'T ACCEPT THE TRIAL! Tandem and Google Play are scamming together as there's no 7-day trial, they immediately charge you. Fortunately, I could dispute directly with Tandem with an email as they're based in Germany. Girls must understand we as men send many messages to men and women. Men never reply or they're LGBTQ, and women never write back because either they think we're flirting or because they're boring and don't even know what they're doing in this app! Total trash, not for languages!"
net.tandem,It's been quite a great experience for a while. I paid for 3 months pro package and I've been using it for about three weeks when suddenly the app just stopped working. It worked again after some hours so it was probably the glitch that everyone's here been talking about. I hope dev team can do something about it because I regularly practice there.
net.tandem,"Exploitative trash design. Makes you wait upon sign up, but you can bypass by paying a fee. since when does signing up to anything take time? Wana use basic features? Subscribe. But since you are new, here is a discount on the 1 year sub. Oh you want to sub for just 1 week to try it out? You can't for 24 hours until the offer expires for the 1 year sub. Disgustingly scummy money squeezing design."
net.tandem,"for no reason it stops sending me notifications of messages also there is something wrong when i write, like if the keyboard isn't lagging, it happens only on it"
net.tandem,"Often adding new features, if only with there was a way to access from my pc, like italki's website. Update: free usability has been stripped back significantly, and that would be fine, I would be willing to pay modestly, but the app seems to be dead, with fewer people online to study with. Back when the app was better for free users, I would have messages from new people almost every day."
net.tandem,good but time zones are anoying
net.tandem,Great App for learing and know people around world
net.tandem,"I (a minor) keep receiving messages from pedophiles trying to get me to use telegram to ""exchange freaky videos."" I've reported this multiple times with the chat messages attached and all I get are bot responses from moderator accounts saying the user received a warning. They likely don't get banned because they pay for pro. A warning doesn't do much, does it? These grown men still keep messaging me"
net.tandem,I obviously like this app it's really helpful and people are really friendly I love this
net.tandem,I've had this app for over 5 years and features that used to be free are all becoming paid. Even to learn more than one language you have to pay for tandem pro. It's not worth it. App is extracting all value for shareholders at this point. Look elsewhere.
net.tandem,"Haven't tried the app fully yet. I will say, however, that is pretty outrageous that there's not a third/nonbinary gender option in 2026. Be more inclusive. Especially funny that the first thing that pops up when you sign up is ""we celebrate diversity"", including ""gender identity"" and yet the only two options are ""male"" and ""female"" 😐"
net.tandem,"Apesar de alguns bugs no app, ainda assim não deixa a desejar em nada. Excelente app pra aprender idiomas através de conversação. It is worth it 👌"
net.tandem,Es la mejor aplicación para encontrar personas para platicar idiomas. Siempre hay alguien que está dispuesto a compartir y aprender. He conocido a mucha gente interesante de distintos países. Ha sido una experiencia bien positiva.
net.tandem,"It's great, They just lack of update"
net.tandem,add and update the features. allow users to upload and send videos for an update.
net.tandem,found it so nice and helpful
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,very good.
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"6 days I have been waiting for support to contact me. As a lifetime pro member I would expect a response from someone. Extremely bad, ignoring issues reported is not acceptable. I have reported multiple times and filled out multiple support forms and still nothing."
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,This is a great app for learning new languages.
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,good app
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"Brilliant learning app, however it's a shame you can no longer use if offline with the new versions of the app"
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,good
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"It's great. I love it, it helps someone learn quickly more than Duolingo"
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"2015: it is legitimately fun to learn with memrise, i'm not even kidding i can now learn german and japanese when i can't sleep at night or during pauses in the day. also it's fairly easy so that's always a plus. so if ur thinking about it... just try it out bc youll probably be glad you did :D 2026- They removed ASL from the main app. Very stupid. Those courses are the only thing that has kept me coming back: what they call the 'community courses' are some of the coolest ones. They're removed."
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,A very good app. Makes Duolingo look pathetic
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,Not great for memory or long term language skills. material is not designed or laid out in a way that encourages long-term memory and engagement. The app will allow you to continuously make mistakes without correcting you so you actually memorize improper sentence structure. the native language speaker is great but there's downsides to how they present it
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"The ""hear my words"" section it's Ads even in paid version. That is truly bad"
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,good
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"In an era where apps like Duolingo replaced everything with AI, we gotta appreciate apps like Memrise. Here you can find videos of real conversations, real native speakers, videos and content from real artists and content creators. Damn, Memrise, we're so lucky to have you. You also integrated AI, but it's just a part of the experience (to help with our writing), not your only focus."
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,Add Bengali Language. In total world population one of the most talked Language is Bengali
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,very usfull and easy platrform
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,Good 👍
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"Was working fine, then I added a word list, now it won't let me change the word list or show progress. Stuck in a five word loop, tried reinstalling and deleting and restarting the language. Had to completely delete my account and restart from scratch. Watch out for community word lists..."
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,way better than duolingo
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"I love this app, and I've been using it for almost a year now. I highly recommend it!"
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,I adore this app! The one thing I wish it would have is the ability to slow down (and speed up) the audio playback speed for sentences. I've frequently had to ask my Polish partner to say a sentence more slowly for me instead because the Memrise one is too fast for me as a beginner 😔
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"Love the app. Not the biggest fan of ""Hear My Words"" section, but the app keeps on pushing it. There should be an option to turn off notifications on features that the user does not want to use."
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,why is ai necessary?
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,it good for learning languages Download and learn ur favorite language
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,Too expensive just get Anki
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,"if your progression stats are important to you, don't use this app!"
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,Love it
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,this app is the best. If u want to learn to read and write and also communicate with local people in any other language then this is like ur weapon. I loved this. Fir me it is 10/10
com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,very good

com.magoosh.gre.quiz.vocabulary,❤️❤️❤️
com.magoosh.gre.quiz.vocabulary,really good if you use it like you're supposed to
com.magoosh.gre.quiz.vocabulary,so many new words very cool. proper definitions / a link to a dictionary entry would be nice and very convenient to help words that have multiple meanings and to understand the full definition but perhaps just keeping a physical dictionary is better anyway. 10/10 nice start to learning new words.
com.magoosh.gre.quiz.vocabulary,Good

com.langotalk.app,helps me learn new languages fast
com.langotalk.app,I had a self-induced payment issue and contacted them for help and it was fixed so quickly. Really appreciated the great customer service.
com.langotalk.app,nice
com.langotalk.app,This app is good however there are certain phrases that get marked wrong no matter how I say it or pronounce it. there is seemingly no reason why I get it wrong because my in person teacher told me I'm saying them right. it sort of drives you nuts and you loose hearts over what is essentially a bug.
com.langotalk.app,i like it
com.langotalk.app,I like it but I'm not using it & cannot find any way to cancel the subscription!
com.langotalk.app,"I used Duolingo for a year. though it is good for learning basics, but I find it boring lately. with langotalk, it is flexible. you can learn much more as the conversation are like the conversation you have in the real world. you learn much quicker this way. I bought the life time subscription on cyber monday last week and I am enjoying the app and learned a lot already."
com.langotalk.app,So far so good good. Is like talking to a real person. It will give you suggestions of how to improve you vocabulary. 👍
com.langotalk.app,superb
com.langotalk.app,Won't let me delete my account and the lessons are terrible. The good comments are so misleading.
com.langotalk.app,"Nunca pensé que una aplicación con pocas descargas sería tan buena, de verdad recomendadisima, es gratis, lo que te dice en italiano lo puedes seleccionar y te lo dice en español y simplemente la recomiendo a full ya que otras aplicaciones te piden cada rato que pagues para más conversación pero esta es mucho mejor."
com.langotalk.app,Fun but in a challenging way!

com.langotalk.app,it's helpful
com.langotalk.app,nice
com.langotalk.app,"Slop, pretty much chatgpt functionality except you pay them for the subscription"
com.langotalk.app,this is way better than Duolingo and very helpful makes you learn real words that you will be using in the conversation opposite of Duolingo which says the same words 10 times
com.langotalk.app,this is the absolute worst of AI slop. no way that's comparable to a human conversation
com.langotalk.app,doesn't work due to sanctions one Star with love ❤️😘
com.langotalk.app,"I'm still new in using the app. But, I have to say it's very interactive, which I find useful since I don't have korean friends as of yet to practice speaking and exercising my already existing vocabulary."
com.langotalk.app,I love this website for the lingo talk it is the best website to learn a new language I tell you now and I think you all should be very proud of yourself for creating this beautiful app and keep going and don't stop no matter what anybody else tells you or rates you do not stop use are the best keep going and keep up the good hard work I'm rooting for you it's all good on us all and I love this all so much
com.langotalk.app,👍 great app danke
com.langotalk.app,"I can't even rate this terrible app,I don't want anything to do with it anymore so I want to delete my account and uninstall,but app wouldn't let me delete my account 😤"
com.langotalk.app,"first time using it, ill change my review after a week or month."

com.atistudios.italk.ja,"It was ok. User onboarding was fairly smooth, not too annoying with premium mode pop-ups but free mode is heavily limited. The conversation mode was ok but very basic. Looking for a practical speaking type of app so am not sure if free mode would be too helpful."

com.atistudios.italk.ja,💯
com.atistudios.italk.ja,so good
com.atistudios.italk.ja,good
com.atistudios.italk.ja,"I really like so far. It's quite simple and to easy to use and most importantly fixes the problem I had with duolingo without being overly repetitive and making translate weird sentences. It's pretty solid, highly recommend."
com.atistudios.italk.ja,"just tried it to see. the audio varies wildly in quality, the lessons cycle through the same few sentences, the chatbot uses a weird mix of phrases with a bit of keigo and it wouldn't accept はい、元気です as a reply to お元気ですか, instead it wanted the answer to be 良かった which is not a valid answer in Japanese? maybe my level is too advanced (wanted an app to brush up on my Japanese, but I used to be at n2-levels, so that might be it), but with these basic wrongs I wouldn't recommend this to a beginner."
com.atistudios.italk.ja,تطبيق رائع للتعليم
com.atistudios.italk.ja,open
com.atistudios.italk.ja,"These learning apps have a few days free use before you purchase it and you can cancel subscription anytime, it is very useful if you want to learn other languages like me learning Japanese daily. You can choose daily timing from 5 to 20 mins."
com.atistudios.italk.ja,really good recommend it
com.atistudios.italk.ja,well done app for beginners
com.atistudios.italk.ja,great
com.atistudios.italk.ja,"good idea with ai leening, but lessons don't work and get stuck half way thorugh. won't pay for that. edit: the ""speak"" feature got labelled as ""AI"" at some point in the App."
com.atistudios.italk.ja,"i paid for an annual subscription, but they continued to ALSO charge me monthly. be careful. unethical!"
com.atistudios.italk.ja,it had me take a placement test and despite getting higher results the lessons started from 0
com.atistudios.italk.ja,It 'S Really Amazing
com.atistudios.italk.ja,this app is very useful for everyone who wanna learn languages .
com.atistudios.italk.ja,It is good if you know how to read japanese
com.atistudios.italk.ja,cool app

com.bal.listenboise,I love this app! We live in a rural area where radio reception is spotty. Being able to listen to local channels is a treat!
com.bal.listenboise,love it!! my Bull station goes wherever I go!!
com.bal.listenboise,love that I am able to listen whenever and wherever I want
com.bal.listenboise,"The audio anytime you open the app or pause and then replay it has made it so I miss things quite often. The app also randomly closes and I have to reopen it then listen to that audio clip. If someone calls me and I answer it, I have to listen to that audio clip again before I can listen to the radio. It didn't used to have that audio clip. I was driving today and I switched from my Wi-Fi at home to a cell tower and it had to go through that audio clip! It is so annoying."
com.bal.listenboise,wish my favorite radio station didn't sound like it's on a CD with scratches on the back 😞😔😞😔😞😔
com.bal.listenboise,"All I could do is get it to open the home splash screen. No menu, no radio stations. A complete waste of time."
com.bal.listenboise,"There isn't a better way to start my weekday. I LOVE listening to Joey and Lauren every morning. If I'm not in the car, Alexa plays it for me, which I love. I hope they never leave radio!"
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,"I have been banned for no reason, also, i tried creating a new account with a different email id and i ended up with the same message from the app that i have been banned. It would be sensible of you if you solve this problem."
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,"It was great, now its just chatting with ai, so sad"
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,worst app
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,It was a very good app before it loses all its bright. I used to spend hours and hours talking to strangers all around the world but now all those human shining touches have gone. Very sad for this.
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,Very bad comparing to early performance. This is the result of focusing only on profit. Profit making is important but should not be the sole aim.The overall rating now is a lesson for app devolopers
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,"when I first used this app 6 years ago, it was a blessing. but now it is ruined by ai. We don't need professional paid teachers. I just want to speak with foreigners on video chat like old days💔"
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,this app is good before. they removed the live call
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,"It was once the best app, now it's not even useful anymore. They don't only make a downgrade but also disconnect people. This downfall should be studied by other developers so they don't make the same mistakes."
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,It's not like before !
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,"it was my favotite app learn English and meet new people. Now it turned to garbage. no streaming, no instamatch just adds, course and monetization focused."
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,worst progression of the app
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,it became worst last two years.
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,Soo Bad Dont Download - back then this app ws really good allowed us to speak with strangers random for free and I loved it back then. Now this has lost his point and never download this.
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,not good
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,honestly I used to use this app when it had irl teachers friends and stuff like that now all and everything is ai it's boring.. honestly I had so many teachers and friends but now..it's just AI.
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,not to payed
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,I use this app when I was actually young and learning English this app helped me so much but now you can't talk to people I had used this app maybe 4 5 years and now when I download this app it is totally changed sad for this app owner who did changed everything miss old version I have never again seen anywhere same old version of this app can't forget
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,"Hallo app used to be super amazing. It had great features. You could do live streams, talk to people, make friends, join teachers' sessions, and interact with them. But nowadays, it's just disappointing me. I never expected the day would come when I'd have to write such a bad review."
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,once upon a time I used this app for free chat. but of late I cannot do it. please help me someone
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,"Joon & Ben as owner of this app just sell this app! so sad, are u ok to see the rate is about 3.1 here? it was favorit app before. Yeah but we know all people need money so do Joon & Ben."
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,"It was wonderful app before then they become greedy and removed all the good features like live calling, group calling, many other features now they only wants to earn money"
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,This app becomes trash now after removing the instamatch and other features.
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,i hate this app
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,I was use this app that time was a amazing app for learning but now it's actually going worst now I m going to deleted such scam .
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,it's the worst app of all It is not as good as before now this app charges too much
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,now it is too much bad application because asking for premium .when I installed it 2019 it was a good application we can talk to native speaker now there is no-one to practise english you will earn by AI🤣🤣🤣 it is bad application now so please don't buy any subscription thanks gyes
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,"it was one of my top priority applications, and I have so many friends whom I talk daily and practice my English, but now it's the worst application, removing all the features like insta match live sessions that's wht the rating of this application is 2.9 so my question from you is when you are bringing back insta match and all other features"
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,"This used to be my favorite app with instamatch, now it's absolute garbage."
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,this is the end of the legendary application after the withdrawal of the live stream.
com.halloglobal.flutterapp.hallo,"No-Way!!!, This App One's was the best App for English practice, i use to share it with my Friends so they can practice their English as well. Now it seem Unfamiliar to me at all! Everything Changed including Insta-Match, Why is That ""Hallo"" !!? I'm So Disappointed Honestly."
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,it's excellent
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,très bien je suis content... merci beaucoup pour le app..
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"I really like the app so far! I studied French in uni, so I have some basic skills, and the intermediate level they are suggesting is just what I need. The exercises are quite easy, and I got everything I need without the subscription, there are no ads. If I continue studying for some time, I'll consider subscribing. Thank you!"
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,exceptional app
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,Learning made easy
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,perfect learning app!!!

com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"We are awaiting the Portuguese language , and thank you for your efforts.❤️❤️❤️"
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,Really enjoying the app so far but not long started.
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,Great teaching guide `au revoir
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,Where do I begin to express the gratitude for such a well thought out program. Thank you so much!!! This app is definitely a great tool for people having little or no knowledge of french. The app explains the rules of structure in one sentence. Then adds exemples from words you just learn. I will say it again. Merci beaucoup mes amies à Wlingua.
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,Amazing app!! loved it so much 😍
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,love it!
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,incredible
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"Went to Duolingo first to start learning French but that experience is so frustrating with the free version, so I tried Wlingua (which I had never heard of) and am pleasantly surprised! it has a diversity of lessons: listening, speaking, reading, vocab, and explanation of rules (Duolingo doesn't have that last one). It's free and you don't get cut off at any point. Love it so far!"
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"all the audios have a different quality, after intermidiate level there are no audio conversations at all. i know all the courses become boring but we all know the process"
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,This is the best app I've found for thorough French study. Excellent.
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"This is an awesome app to learn French, there is even an option to ask where you've not understood, I love it."
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,it is an amazing app for learning 🙌
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"The app is difficult to use. I do not feel my French strengthening, rather I feel like I am getting worse using this app."
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"I was looking for a Duolingo alternative which doesn't limit how much I can use it. Wlingua is less flashy and fun, but much more useful for learning. I wish such an app existed for Japanese and Croatian."
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,better than Duolingo
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,Great and grateful.
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"fantastic app, just what i needed to help me learn a new language the right way. great job!"
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,one of the best I tried so far
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,Moron App. It has a speaker pronounce a word and then you have to chose which word he said out of two choices. How does that teach you anything? If you can't pick the right word then you have a hearing problem.
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"monthly price is a bit high, but the app is really good"
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"It's awesome and perfect, thanks all the developers!"
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,just started to use. Looks good.
com.wlingua.frenchcourse,"this app is perfect for learning any language.. I'm learning french with it and the experience has been awesome, I highly recommend it"
com.french.zeemish,everything I need is in this single app you guys deserve more than five stars ratings ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

com.french.zeemish,From day one I love this app but I miuse the opportunity of learning free at my space I had it for like 3 years on my phone and now I logged in today I realized it about money now but notwithstanding I still love everything about it.
com.french.zeemish,good app
com.french.zeemish,Great
com.french.zeemish,"excellent application, super platform to enhance our knowledge"
com.french.zeemish,C'est une application géniale
com.french.zeemish,nice
com.french.zeemish,Okay my only gripe about this game is I think if you are good at tests then you are not really learning on here. I don't think this is really teaching me I am just passing the tests. I thought at first once I ran out of hearts that was it. But watching two ads is not the worse to get another heart. I think you should try to keep people on this app as long as you can. But take a page from Netflix and charge $7 per month for gold and not $24 per month.
com.french.zeemish,Is a good idea
com.french.zeemish,wow🥰🥰🥰🥰
com.french.zeemish,so fantastic words are well pronounce and as a beginner can learn fast and where I am the done used credit card we use mobile money
com.french.zeemish,this is so incredibly I love it

com.french.zeemish,I like this it really helped me learn french and am from Tanzania 🇹🇿 ✌️
com.french.zeemish,good 👍🏽
com.french.zeemish,"I used to love this app but now it's genuinely terrible. I used it to practice specific words and go through the different categories whenever I wanted This is the app I'd go to AFTER using apps like Duolingo or Lingodeer, but now it's basically just a worse version of them. I am literally begging the developer to go back to how it used to be."
com.french.zeemish,good
com.ewa.ewaapp,"I downloaded and purchased a premium offer. It hasn't updated, so I don't have any premium features. also every time I log in it makes me do the quiz again. the quiz for intermediate German is the same as the quiz for advanced German. I contacted them 3 days ago to request a refund (apparently they offer a refund within 14 days of purchase) but I haven't heard back from them."
com.ewa.ewaapp,good
com.ewa.ewaapp,it was amazing
com.ewa.ewaapp,Best App for learning languages
com.ewa.ewaapp,"I am trying the free trial but have decided that I don't have time to learn, currently. However I cant see how to cancel this free trial or any further subscription payments. I don't want to pay for this. Please could you advise. I tried emailing the contact given on your website but it bounced back. Thank you. Sarah"

com.ewa.ewaapp,useful
com.ewa.ewaapp,good
com.ewa.ewaapp,It's an amazing interactive app! I learn English with fun.
com.ewa.ewaapp,Great app. Bbut I think it's a bit underrated.
com.ewa.ewaapp,"The lessons are slow and ineffective. The ai never loads. one of the main reasons I picked this up was to have conversations with ai. Finally, the games are too easy and ineffective. I'm not actually learning."
com.ewa.ewaapp,Tried to buy an app for learning Spanish and got directed to this thing instead. How useless some organisations are!
com.ewa.ewaapp,waoooooooooo very good 😊😊😊😊💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
com.ewa.ewaapp,😍
com.ewa.ewaapp,"Amazing language learning app, although I still don't know why I paid for it, turns out free-version is as good as the paid version, so long that you watch ads. My only complaint is that, the paid version is way too expensive, a language learning app in this calibre should offer more for the paid-version, 10 usd monthly is way too much, deserves at least 5 usd per month with this content."
com.ewa.ewaapp,Great program. I especially like the reading/listening option for books.
com.ewa.ewaapp,very nice step
com.ewa.ewaapp,კაია
com.ewa.ewaapp,Excellent
com.ewa.ewaapp,de cacat
com.ewa.ewaapp,This app is basically stealing money. I strongly recommend that you never install it.
com.ewa.ewaapp,conversation at a coffee shop.. no video!!
com.ewa.ewaapp,Good overall App still needs work. There are incorrect translations in the books and only a few books have nice voices reading them (the Oxford reading section) the rest are robotic and unbearably awful sounding and there is simply no excuse for this living in the days of ai voices it could easily be fixed. this app may become 5 stars down the road but for now it is incomplete and needs lots of work.
com.ewa.ewaapp,fantastic
com.ewa.ewaapp,The pronunciation is bad and the lessons are too easy. It costs too much.
com.ewa.ewaapp,amazing 👏

com.google.android.apps.youtube.music,Been using YT Music for years with YT Premium. The improvements made on the app have been noticeable and appreciated. It's my main app for music on all devices due to ease and quality. But smart downloads are still inconvenient since you can't delete individual songs from a playlist..

com.atistudios.mondly.id,yes i am also be use app for appreciate
com.atistudios.mondly.id,love this app
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Thank you very much
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Entertaining but the constant pop up ads ruin the experience a bit
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Easy and fixable
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Very disappointed I had to give up after 200 words as the app didn't understand me. I repeated myself so many times and it still didn't understand. I feel I gave it a fair go. Paid for a years subscription and barely got a month. Not real happy.
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Good
com.atistudios.mondly.id,"It's a great language learning app. The realistic and applicable sentences/phrases provided throughout the course really make this app stand out of all the choices in the market. I love the daily lessons to review, in addition to the lessons tree you have in the learning program. I find the subscription plan is reasonable for what you get, thus being a good investment in your learning. Only learning app I'm paying for right now."
com.atistudios.mondly.id,I really love this app. It's very easy and convenient.
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Very nice app
com.atistudios.mondly.id,I subscribed for 1 year pack. Money was deducted from my account but?Locked features are not unlocking for me.Either I should be enabled or my money should be refunded.😒
com.atistudios.mondly.id,It's so good luck with you tonight Mum I
com.atistudios.mondly.id,easy to use
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Good
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Rosemary Radeva
com.atistudios.mondly.id,"The app is nice. So I probably like it, it improve my learning skills very well."
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Nice concept.
com.atistudios.mondly.id,So far i have been using for 3 days and its been great. Simple and interactive. Easy to use. No adds at moment. It has a hands free option that i havent used yet
com.atistudios.mondly.id,"Guter Einstieg, um indonesische Basics zu lernen. Aber es gibt 2 große Nachteile: 1. Es wird nur förmliches Indonesisch beigebracht, das in der Realität kaum Anwendung findet. Zb im Warung (Restaurant) ruft man nicht den Kellner her. Folgt man blind der App, macht man sich lächerlich 2. Synonyme Antworten werden als falsch gewertet und nur eine Version ist richtig. In der Realität ist Sprache aber keine höhere Mathematik, sondern es geht um Verständnis. Dieses fehlt der App leider. Bitte ändern!"
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Excellent
com.atistudios.mondly.id,"C'est excellent, mais il a un petit soucis... Pourquoi seul le cour ""Bonjour"" est gratuit ? Ce n'est donc pas une application d'apprentissage, mais une application d'initiation !"
com.atistudios.mondly.id,learn a lot thank u
com.atistudios.mondly.id,"Good learning tool but way, way too much pushy about its Premium features."
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Unsubscribed after 10 minutes realising it was to difficult for me but they had taken the years subscription....have not responded to my refund request be careful before buying the yearly subscription. Also there was supposed to be a free period of time which I foolishly thought would count for not taking the money from my account until time was up...there are plenty of excellent free apps that I have discovered.
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Good
com.atistudios.mondly.id,So far so good. If I experience any issues I will take a star off
com.atistudios.mondly.id,Very nice
com.atistudios.mondly.id,"Not a bad program, had problems renewing my subscription. The new pricing makes me glad i bought it 6 years ago as I would not pay the present fees."
com.atistudios.mondly.id,"Loveee and there is no bugs, glitches or lags! Great app to learn Indonesian"
com.atistudios.mondly.id,User friendly
com.udemy.android,Love the working and the courses
com.udemy.android,Videos stop playing randomly. Steps to reproduce: - start watching a course - turn off the screen - videos will stop playing (not because a class ended) ----- it's amazing that all over the internet users want a feature to restart a course... it will never be implemented.
com.udemy.android,The worst app when I cancel my course already 3 weeks completed refund is not created to my account
com.udemy.android,this app constantly crashes and/or improperly displays information
com.udemy.android,Great app layout to learn in bite sizes on the go
com.udemy.android,they say that you will get 30 days money back guarantee but they don't provide the refund its a fraud going on
com.udemy.android,fantastic app which helps me in every possible way
com.udemy.android,I want the automatic AI summary in the footer like before
com.udemy.android,good beginning!
com.udemy.android,nice app
com.udemy.android,You lose courses you've paid for for a variety of reasons. I did. DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM UDEMY!
com.udemy.android,it's a great place to learn anything you want!
com.udemy.android,wonderful app. I learned so much from this. Love when the sales happen
com.udemy.android,good explanation
com.udemy.android,The developers should be ashamed of this app. Frequently it is unable to play videos that are already downloaded to the device. It will also stop playing videos completely. I restarted my device and can only play one or two videos until the app stops working again.
com.udemy.android,"The downloading of videos to watch offline is a scam. I still had to use data to watch videos I've downloaded, the ""downloaded "" videos won't play at all...so disappointing"
com.udemy.android,app sucks! have 3 courses downloaded and won't play. keeps crashing!! and now the Ads! from bad to worst
com.udemy.android,too many ad on course for each session just can't focus
com.udemy.android,I just wanted to leave a review about your website. It is having serious problems ever since you introduced AI. The AI keeps removing all of the sections in my course content and then I have to tell it to stop. I can't turn that junk off. The AI assistant is ruining everything about my experience. also your system doesn't work very well when used on Ubuntu.
com.udemy.android,"Videos cannot be zoomed in, so small text cannot be read."
com.udemy.android,It has plenty of courses for elevating anyone's personal development
com.udemy.android,good
com.udemy.android,"Short, practical, and genuinely useful. The real-world examples made it even better."
com.udemy.android,don't purchase from udemy as they have fake promises 30 days money back guarantee. Never fall for this trap.
com.udemy.android,Amazing
com.udemy.android,why you made the app where i can not play the video. With a note that view video by computer. is it a joke?
com.udemy.android,Well explained course who wanna learn avt seos and keywords
com.udemy.android,"Strange refund policy terms. After realizing that the course is not offering what the instructor has promised, you press refund and you get an immediate decline message 'you have watched too much'. And you have watched at the end 3 out of 54 sections...."
com.udemy.android,user friendly
com.udemy.android,"Very bad app with no respect to customer's experiences, which is very controlling and not allowing customers to cast their beloved courses on smart tv blocking the DRM handshakes also not allowin course owners to play their bought download courses outside the app.. so you buy courses but you have no control over them and actually you don't own them, you get stuck in the platform which keeps using you for its marketing system to generate more profits! so you don't own the content, but they own u"
com.duocards.app,"Thanks to this app I've learnt tons of vocabulary in Italian, French and English, thanks for this. If anyone's wondering if it's worth it paying the subscription, it absolutely is."
com.duocards.app,What I love about DuoCards is that the people who made it still care about the people who wants to learn. While most other apps are trying to make as much money as possible these guys are genuinely willing to help people learn a new language.
com.duocards.app,I hope that in the next update there will be a feature on how to pronounce a word properly especially learning English . thank you
com.duocards.app,"I really like the DuoCards app, but I have 3 suggestions for improvement. 1) The pronunciation of the word “compulsion” is incorrect, please check 2) It would be great to have different English pronunciation/vocabulary options, as I need Australian English. 3) When tapping a word, the dictionary should allow users to choose between different parts of speech instead of selecting one automatically. Overall, the app has strong potential, and I hope these improvements will be implemented."
com.duocards.app,It's the best app!!! Thanks for constantly improving it!
com.duocards.app,"App will not work without purchase. Falsely claims to offer a limited ""free"" option. After enrolling, it asks if I want to subscribe without offering a ""no"" option. Can't close ""subscribe"" screen, restarting app returns to ""Subscription"" screen."
com.duocards.app,love it
com.duocards.app,"I tried this app. I subscribed, then cancelled when I realized it would not work for me. they kept my money and said they would cancel after a year. I requested it immediately. check my usage data."
com.duocards.app,learning is good
com.duocards.app,es muy bueno practicar en duo cards palabras porque las aprendes fácil y rápido .
com.duocards.app,"I Like the cards functionality, but the test chat makes a lot of mistakes"
com.duocards.app,"I don't usually give out ratings, but man, just get this app. It's: 1.) A true language learning freemium app. Very usable without payment and the ""ads"" aren't annoying either. If I had the money, I would get it just as a donation to the devs for making such a fine app. 2.) AMAZING for vocabulary, explains words, generates nice icons, allows you to answer by typing out the answer or saying it out (you can also just flip the card) -Include AI feature that accepted nuance (e.g. Es-tu vs. Tu es)"
com.duocards.app,"I don't understand why such a simple application can't be made offline, it's impossible for the words that I learn to be downloaded to my phone. And this is all despite the fact that I have the paid version"
com.duocards.app,"Simple, cheap and helpful. I love it."
com.duocards.app,I'm glad you kept your promise.
com.duocards.app,the best application
com.duocards.app,its really good and I think it will be a very good source but from my experience after like 27 flashcards? it wouldn't let me do anything unless I subscribe and pay so I won't say it's bad but it's also not good in a way 👍
com.duocards.app,"The best language learning app of all time and space. After installing this app, life became more beautiful, and learning languages became easier.This app in 10,000,000 stars. Thank you very much to those who developed it."
com.duocards.app,"Die effektivste App zum Vokabellernen, die ich je ausprobiert habe! Hilft wirklich sehr gut beim Einprägen der Wörter und ist niedlich gestaltet. Macht sehr viel Spaß, danke fürs Erstellen der App :)"
com.duocards.app,"This app would have been a clear five-star one, weren't it for the fact that it doesn't really realize its potential (I'm a subscriber). AI coupled with flashcards is a powerful combination, but grammar explanations all look the same (they should be more varied and complete) and examples are often repeating. The Listen feature is very powerful, but we should be able to filter by set of cards. This together with a better production of examples would be great. Looking forward to updates."
com.duocards.app,great 👍
com.duocards.app,"I subscribed to the paid version and after a while the app just shut down on me, and it won't start no matter what! What kind of cheating is this? DON'T INSTALL."
com.duocards.app,fantastic
com.duocards.app,best for memorizing words
com.duocards.app,very useful app. love it but I would prefer a lifetime deal though
com.duocards.app,i usually don't review apps but the app is very helpful and has a lot of great features that i have been looking for in a long time. the app is worth it for you to try .
com.duocards.app,limitation for card adding is too low
com.duocards.app,I do enjoy this app but it would be great to have furigana over the kanji in the sentences for the words.
com.duocards.app,"DuoCards is a highly effective and well-designed application for expanding vocabulary in a structured and engaging way. Its spaced repetition system ensures long-term retention, while the ability to create custom flashcards and learn from authentic content such as videos and texts makes the learning process both practical and motivating. The interface is sleek, intuitive, and easy to navigate, even for advanced learners."
com.duocards.app,"It's a really good app, but their server is out of service or experiences delays most of the time for speaking. It would be a really useful app if they upgraded their resources."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"really useful for me as an addition to Duolingo, it teaches grammar rules making sense of some of the stuff you learn but is not explained by Duolingo. You need to be studying french at the same time as using this app, it's definitely a supplement to learning not a language learning tool on its own. Also helps if you know grammar terms in English."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,very expensive compared to what you get
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,top mais juste pour la version premium
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"La mejor aplicación para aprender francés. Super accesible y completa, vale totalmente la pena adquirirla completa para estudiar por niveles."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,very good
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,i don't know how to unlock other lessons

com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Boring
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"If you don't plan on paying, don't bother with this app. Most content is locked in the free version, so much so that you can't even learn just the basics."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Great app but you have pay otherwise you can only access some lessons
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Thank you very much 😭😭😭
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"C'est magnifique, je viens juste de commencer à l'utiliser pour approfondir mes connaissances en franças quand il s'agit de la grammaire, et je vois déjà beaucoup des progrès avec tous est-ce que je sais en français, et en plus je me sens encore plus sûr de c'est-ce que je dit :) merci beaucoup pour cette appli, il m'a souve comme je n'habite pas dans un pays où le français est parlé, alors pour tous ces gens qui aimeraient améliorer en grammaire, utilise-le :) et encore une fois de plus, merci."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,J'adore le Dr French. Cette app est super. Tu adore aussi. Les leçons sont interrestines . I love Dr French. This app is great. You love it too. The lessons are interesting.
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"I wish I hadn't paid for this, though it's relatively cheap. I constantly have to google for clarification in lessons. The very first most basic lesson about sentence structure assumes you know how indirect objects function in French. I had to use Busuu to find a clear lesson about it. I don't think this is appropriate for beginners, but probably great if you already know a bit about French grammar."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"very helpful, with good explanations and effective practice exercises. well worth $8 full version"
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"Bastante buena la app solo que hay bloqueos de algunos temas lo cuales dificultan el auto aprendizaje de los mismos ,si hubiese sido mas abierta en ese sentido coloco las 5 estrellas ."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Good for learning French grammar.Easy to understand.
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Very nice app and best for students 😃😃😃👍👍👍
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"Thank you so much for clarified me out about this application, before I couldn't speak 🙊 french but now i wish can try to do my best 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰"
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Best app especially if you dont love learning in a basic set up.
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,It helps you to know more about french
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,It helps one to learn french as part of his or life
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"Good app. However, some lessons are too short so you cannot understand, which is pretty bad. For example, the lesson ""how to conjugate the present indicative 1"" is useless, it explains too little about the features and norms for the second group of regular verbs (-ir), something too important. Overall, I like the app, but you should put more attention to these factors, so everyone can understand fully. Plus, It has minor errors in some chapters, like ""how to use: combien ?"" That gotta be fixed."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Great!

com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"A solid, comprehensive app to learn (or review) French grammar. It explains concepts well and is nicely organized, with lots of quizzes to practice as you go along. Minor complaints = it should open to where you left off and remember what level you chose. The feedback on wrong answers to quizzes is often completely useless."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,I appreciate it 97% good
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,"This is a wonderful app, but it needs to be used in tandem with other practice oriented apps such as Duolingo. This app fills a very important void in our learning space, so that we not only know what is happening, but we get you know WHY and HOW it's happening."
com.thegrammaruniversity.drfrench,Just did the update and I see know option to change to the dark mode :-( Cannot use it anymore..
ai.praktika.android,amazing

ai.praktika.android,"I literally just installed the app. I haven't used it enough to give a solid review, but it seems good."
ai.praktika.android,You should probably get Your translation's correct in the advertisement. Me llamo es is not technically correct which is what your ad says. It literally says technically correct but most people say me llamo. This technically means I call myself is
ai.praktika.android,this is so cool you can speak to this teachers and they could help you to correct your language on a better way.
ai.praktika.android,"love it, its not free but it's worth it if you are a serious learner"

Uważam że powinniście dodać jakąś stricte darmową opcje, nie tylko okres próbny ale ogólnie non premium opcja oczywiście z mniejszymi udogodnieniami i ewentualnymi reklamami bo wiem że z czegoś musicie zarabiać."
ai.praktika.android,it's very helpful for me to improve my english
ai.praktika.android,"does NOTT have russian, very disappointing"

ai.praktika.android,otimo
ai.praktika.android,"I'm really upset because I was charged a 3 month subscription through the website. I was sent the email to set a password, but it was a broken link, and now I'm out $20. That may not be a lot, but it is for someone who struggles living paycheck to paycheck! But I was willing to pay it anyways! Now I'm on the app and it's wanting me to pay after only 7 days??? I either need this link in my email fixed or I need my money back. I don't care which."
ai.praktika.android,"This is great, I felt like talking to a native english speaker."
com.language.french5000wordswithpictures,dumbest thing you can waste your time on. s

com.language.french5000wordswithpictures,"I have not been able to use the app, I get a pimsleur ad that won't go away after it plays, and it plays every time."
com.language.french5000wordswithpictures,the worst UI ever
com.language.french5000wordswithpictures,"A good app with in depth vocab, but unfortunately doesn't include articles with the words."
com.language.french5000wordswithpictures,Interessant
com.language.french5000wordswithpictures,App looks great but I can't understand why words don't include articles. It's hard to learn the language without it.
com.language.french5000wordswithpictures,"Great concept, but can't trust the translations, so you might be wasting your time learning."
com.language.french5000wordswithpictures,"i realy like this app,it is very interesting"

com.language.french5000wordswithpictures,Beautiful
com.language.french5000wordswithpictures,Wow
com.language.french5000wordswithpictures,as a French speaker I wouldn't expect from an app aiming to teach French not to pronounce the words properly. In most of the cases the words sound like coming out from a broken pc

com.gymglish.ftqmobile,I love it. I'm an A1 in French and this app help me a lot.
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"OMG I'm in love with this app. I've just downloaded and tried it but it's very helpful and simple. I could adjust the weakness point at my own pace of study. I love how the correction explains the mistake and gives the tip. It's a shame it's not free, but this app is totally amazing. So much better than the many other apps that I tried before. 100/10 💖"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,no it is my dad's phone that I am using it is anytime my daddy comes back from work that I am using but the time that he travels I will not have time 😘😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆👍🏼😆😆🙏🏾😂😂👍🏾😊📷🍿😀😃😄😅😅😁😆😘☀️🙏🏼😂👍👍🏼😊🤪🙈💩🤖👺👹👽👾😹😼😽😽🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀😽😼😻😹🧡💥💨💦💦🌟🌟⭐🌟💤🕳️🔥💜💯🎉🎉❤️🧡💛💛💚💚💚💚💙💙💜💜🤎🤎🤎💗💖💘💘🤍🖤🤍💖💗💗💝💘💘💝💖💖💗💗💓💞💕👥👤🗣️🗣️💌💟💟♥️♥️❣️❤️‍🩹💔💔❤️‍🔥💋💋🫂🦠🫁🩸🫀🧠👣🗣️👤👥🦷🦴👀👁️👄👅👃🏼👂🏼🦻🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🦻🏿💪🏿🙋🏿🙋🏿🙇🏿🙇🏿i
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Lessons and grammatical explanations are good, but the lessons are ridiculously limited. You only get one very short lesson a day and even though it says you can get a maximum of seven lessons per week, I'm only able to get them on weekdays. Nothing on weekends. So that's a max of five per week. If you want to increase your language abilities in a hurry, don't count on this app. Plus it's higher priced than most of the language apps I've tried. So I'm paying maximum price for minimum services."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"It's really quite a lovely app. Though it just gives you a free trial and then you have to get a subscription. But if you can afford it, you should subscribe. I think it's a great combination with Duolingo."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,impeccable. Just excellent. please please make another version of this app for German
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,costs money
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,Enjoyable app with excellent customer service.
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,All lessons unavailable
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Definitely the best French learning app I've ever seen. Simply extraordinary! It encourages you to read more and more French in a challenging way (differently from Duolingo), while also adapting the lessons to your level (differently from Babbel). Simply the best!"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,not good
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,You can't unsubscribe. The quality of the lessons is low. Don't buy them.
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Too expensive, in 7 days trial, you don't even tell what is included in this price because next lessons are hidden, I don't see the program. Also, to identify the level of my French, I have to go through 7-day testing. 7 days to know what my French level is. Hilarious. What if I was sick and missed one day? I have to pay you $300? I have many things to write, but yeah, it's really not worth it."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,Frantastique is superb. Wish there could be longer drama clips made to watch out of learning space
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"its such a good app,i love it!thanks for lessons ❤️‍🩹"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Non potendosi permettere di pagare il corso, è data la possibilità di inviare un link e, se la persona utilizza l'app tu ottieni due mesi gratuiti e lei uno. Ebbene non ha funzionato, di conseguenza ho perso tempo ad inviare il link: grazie frantastique"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"I really liked this app because it really teaches french including grammar in french with option to translate. It also has cultural content and option to choose french/canadian. The reason that I do not continue beyond the trial is the limited amount of lessons per week and the lack of repetition. If would work extremely well with one of these duo-lingo style app, if it was using same vocabulary. and then there is a small issue with the start of the audio getting cut of when listening first time"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Challenging,that is why I like it,but entertaining too."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,excellent app!
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,Doesn't work
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Misleading. Here it initially makes it seem like after 1 test lesson, the app starts to adapt to your level of fluency & tailor the lessons to you. You get a 7-day free trial so that seems long enough to gauge how things work. However, they don't adjust the lessons until AFTER you take 7 difficult lessons in 7 days. Essentially, you can't experience the app properly until you pay. I'm a beginner & wasn't scoring more than 60% on any lesson, discouraging & difficult to continue the 7 lessons"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,Best app learning french
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,It's a fun way to learn and practice. I usually look forward to have my lesson.
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Extremely expensive, but cool concept."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"Started well; tested l to evaluate user fluency, to tailor content. But inflexible, doesn't see when you've got it right if you include the next word as well, as in ""moins vite"" which didn't require the ""vite"". I've answered «on a répète» rather the «on a répéter». In the correction, I'd like to see the verb conjugated to put my error in context."
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,Great way to improve your French.
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,"it means a lot to me,everyday my lessons going better"
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,very good app 👍
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,this programme is was interesting and i love that
com.gymglish.ftqmobile,tres bonne application j ai mis 5 étoiles

It use to be my go to to suggest to people, they have since locked the flashcards behind a pay wall and I can't suggest it as a top choice anymore. But generally excellent for studying new words and grammar. When we were able to drill the new words and phrases it was the gold standard, wish they locked like the practice videos or quizzes instead"

com.rvappstudios.baby.toddler.kids.games.learning.activity,"My 5 y/o is autistic & just began verbal communication within this last year. We're an independent homeschool family after yrs of public school failures to meet the needs of our older ADHD children. When the economy was affordable we invested in learning toys & games, but today's economy makes that impossible for our family of 6 to manage as housing, food & basic necessities take priority.

com.hellotalk.hellowords,failed to load
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"it's good for enhancing voc, but I thought I could use it as a substitute for HelloTalk, as I wanted to talk with strangers (I meant calling them and having conversations)"
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"Honestly the app is amazing in its array of vocabulary, images, and proper form of vocabulary in different languages (clearly they used natives and specialists) but you cannot review words at will. I am the type that needs to review words every day. if I can't I will lose it. So no matter how much I study, I do not retain the vocab because I cannot review it. such a shame."
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Nice
com.hellotalk.hellowords,great
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"Very very similar to Drops/Droplets. Looks like a blatant rip-off, albeit slightly lower quality/content/options. Still an effective vocab learning tool. Can't figure out how to purchase ""Plus"" without knowing Japanese."
com.hellotalk.hellowords,so good
com.hellotalk.hellowords,👏👏👏
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"I like the app but I have a really annoying problem, during an exercise, after only 4 seconds the app tells the solution... I hate it it's so annoying and counter productive. Can I delete the help in settings or something? I'll give 5 stars if yes."
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Good
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Amaxing
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Very good method for learning word
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Good
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"Immediately wants you to pay (if you don't, you get three free minutes a day, SO GENEROUS), and is absolutely manic and bananas right off. You have to know the language you want to learn going in! This is for expanding vocabulary NOT learning from scratch."
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Good
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"The app failed to load, after several attempts I still couldn't get past the first two questions before it crashed. I love hellotalk but hellowords simply did not work"

com.hellotalk.hellowords,This is an exclusively amazing Language Learning App'.!!.
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Hello Talk has introduce me to use this resource to learn Korean vocabulary and phrases. It's a great method of learning to advance your skills.
com.hellotalk.hellowords,Awesome
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"Плюсы: Очень хорошая удобная графика и дизайн. Минусы: 1. Избранное не работает как отдельная тема. Слова не перемешиваются и избранное не отображается сверху с кнопкой ""возобновить"" 2. В упражнении между двумя картинками верхний всегда правильный. 3. В некоторых темах слова плохо подобраны. Обратите внимание на ""Здоровье1"", ""Здоровье2"". 4. Глаголы в теме ""Глаголы"" не в инфинитиве, а в склонении для ""Я"" 5. Из ""Hellotalk"" можно добавить только те слова которые есть в словарях ""Hellowords"""
com.hellotalk.hellowords,"I am currently using the russian course for my learning. I have noticed that it's like an improved version of the drops flashcard app. The minigames with spelling and matching is very helpful for remembering words. For anyone else that decides to learn a language with a different alphabet, I suggest acquainting yourself with the alphabet in order to do the spelling exercises."

com.selabs.speak,"fun to learn a new language but the practice conversations sucks. it tells you to say something and you say it correctly but it says you're wrong, when it tells you what you should be saying it's not even what it told you to say in the first place. such as once it told me to ask is there a police box near by? I did, it said i was wrong and said i should say Hai, nakushimashita. which means yes I lost it. make no sense and yes I have reported the problem multiple times"

simply.learn.japanese,"Paid $10 to go Pro and unlock 'All Phrases' for Japanese - most of which is just a long list of single words. Each section still barely has 10-20 phrases, for getting around. Alot of which are not useful. Not worth the price. Definitely want a refund."

com.lms.greatlakes,"Neither the paltform, not the team is supportive. For about a month and quarter I am struggling to get a very simple documentation. Processes are similar to slow processing archiac organization."
com.lms.greatlakes,"This is one of the most scamming learning platform. It advertise of free courses. But when you enroll free courses it shows ""only the course content free, buy the certificate to showcase your skills $5""."
com.lms.greatlakes,It's a scam. They redirect you to the web for payment and then stop responding to queries.
com.lms.greatlakes,veru useful app
com.lms.greatlakes,Thank you for free course
com.lms.greatlakes,nice
com.lms.greatlakes,till 2024 there were free access to courses and certificate but now no free certificates even for free courses so disappointed...

com.lms.greatlakes,"I enrolled in a DSBA course. The course had pre-recorded videos, (very poor quality), one mentor took a weekly session , where the mentor was only reading ppt. After completion of the course I applied for many months through this shiit platform and got no interview call. Someone from this shiit platform called me asking about my current status, but unfortunately she also was selling me a Masters course in DSBA. I lost one year and 2 Lakhs. Please don't waste your time and money like me."
com.lms.greatlakes,this is 3rd class app saying the course are free but after completing the course they are not giving the certificate for the free as the course is for free
com.lms.greatlakes,Good app
com.lms.greatlakes,not working
com.lms.greatlakes,this say free course and certificate is costly
com.lms.greatlakes,great app to learn and acquire skills.
com.lms.greatlakes,"I have giving this rating my own. This rating is not requested by the great learning application. I am giving it but my experience. It is best forever. I will never forget it. It is such a very valuable application and it's courses offered by it. One thing of this application which makes it very fantastic is that it is totally free, remember this point. And also suggest to all of those whose backgraund os programming."

com.lms.greatlakes,Stopped working on Android 11 after latest update
com.lms.greatlakes,App doesn't open 😒
com.lms.greatlakes,why are you not showing that it's paid certificate course why you showing in your portfolio that it's free and when I get download and complete my courses then you want money of 299 . If you want then you don't write it's free course ok. Cheap minded people.
com.lms.greatlakes,"I have completed the Introduction to Cybersecurity course, but after completing the quiz at the end, they ask me to pay 349 for the certificate. They don't give any information about paying for the certificate in the whole course or In the information detail brochure. This is very bad. So please keep in mind before pursuing any online course in this app that when you complete the free course, they will charge for the certificate"
com.lms.greatlakes,We need to pay money to get the certificate..

com.arturagapov.ielts,The app is excellent but the bugs are making my learning journey worse. Please fix this issue!
com.arturagapov.ielts,"As of October 2024, this has a bug preventing me from completing the tests as it would just quit the test at some point. In addition, as you progress in learning the vocabulary, there's a point where you need to take some tests to move on, but it's impossible because of the aforementioned. I particularly enjoy the app, but this issue is starting to be a bit frustrating... And yes, I have uninstalled the app, cleared the cache and everything, and just lost my progress in the process."

com.speechling.speechling,it's a great app I love it 😍
com.speechling.speechling,I was so excited to have a feedback heheh
com.speechling.speechling,Die App ist Wunderbar und Interesant
com.speechling.speechling,Very nice app provides audio and written practice. Would be nice to have word definitions when a word is selected rather than having to go search for a definition.
com.speechling.speechling,perfect app and for free?!
com.speechling.speechling,need to show pinyin on hover for dictlation mode
com.speechling.speechling,recommend this useful app....
com.speechling.speechling,very effective for learning in chunks (blocking) you have total control over the spaced repetition and can decide when you're ready to move on.
com.speechling.speechling,"This app is helping me so much that even I couldn't learn that much even in the Russian language course in University. I have a request, Please include Bangla (Bengali) and Arabic. I'll be waiting for it in order to share this app with my family members."
com.speechling.speechling,"really gud app to learn language, but not totally for beginner.. i think its for speaking practice"
com.speechling.speechling,Speachling is an excellent way to improve pronunciation and help beginners feel more confident speaking!
com.speechling.speechling,it's a good app to improve my pronunciation. I like it because it's free.
com.speechling.speechling,"I've tried a lot of apps for language learning (ADHD brain) and Speechling is one of the better ones. There's different options on how you want to learn and at what level. And having the option to have someone actually correct my recordings of what I'm saying is the best option. But I'm shy, so I'll stick with the quizzes."
com.speechling.speechling,it was not installed at all. aweful
com.speechling.speechling,Clearly not what they have mentioned in their adv.
com.speechling.speechling,it's basically the most useful app to learn pronunciation. but as always as in these apps. not everything is translated literally so it's problematic and useless and it takes really long to load another example

com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,only conjugation app with translations
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"Free version provides full course for present and past tense, so much material for a free version to give you a good feel if you want to subscribe to practice the rest."
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,I'm genuinely grateful. The only thing I miss is the IPA - sometimes I hear French pronunciation incorrectly. But I can get that elsewhere. || The extra quizzes and verb groups I saw after paying were more value than the price I paid. It's a wonderful app and a true French language learning accelerator.
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,Incredibly helpful French language learning tool!
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"This app gives us, conjunction with proper pronunciation. It really helps."
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"Absurdly good French practice app. A variety of verbs present and a framework of repetition to learn. I love the quiz options that actually require understanding to pass. I just wish there was some pronunciation to learn, otherwise perfect"
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,Nice app
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"Perhaps a great way to practice your conjugations, but not great for learning them. It breaks up the words into several different sets which makes it impossible to learn conjugation patterns or practice a particular word. Also only includes the understood translations of phrases, not the literal translation. For me personally, this makes it harder to understand and remember what I'm learning if I can't understand why I'm using it."
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"Simple and comprehensive, perfect."
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,Good
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,Great for learning conjugasion
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"The app is very useful for practicing French conjugations. However, many of the translations are just completely wrong which is why I deducted two stars. Make sure your content is actually correct before publishing your app."
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"If you learned French by ear and are now trying to improve your basic written grammar, this is the app. Well worth the fee for the Plus version. This is a great combo of techniques to lock in some conjugation. Multiple choice and write in questions mixed in work different parts of the brain. Great for adults, and probably kicks derriere for kids."
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"I like the app for verb tenses but it would be nice if there was also a way to study the verb vocabulary, like Ella Verbs in Spanish has."
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"You can choose the verbs quizzed, the tenses quizzed, and the types of exercises included on the quiz. Great app for the purpose of learning verbs"
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,An excellent app to learn french verbs. Beginners in learning french should try it.
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,I wish there was a more rounded way to practice.
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,Great! Best app I've found so far for learning French verbs. The learning section is a little dry. But not bad considering it's free.
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,Good app for learning verb conjugation in French. It's quite a handy tool to improve French literacy.
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,Helpful app to learn common verbs with handy lessons.
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,Niceee
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"I love it, perfect if you are a beginner since it gives you the English translation to the infinite verb and the conjugations. Plus, you have audio for all the verbs and conjugations too. A very good app. Well done!"
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"seems great for review, cant wait to have the 5 dollars for plus version. doesnt seem the best for learning conjugations from nothing but seems really good for being able to practice the individual conjugations (surprisingly hard to come by as most apps do all the conjugations per verb at once), once youve already reviewed the verb."
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"Seems like a great app, however its reliance on ""Speech Recognition & Synthesis"" by Google renders it unusable for hearing since it refuses to download French voice data"
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,"Useful, slick app for learning tenses. Minimal spam so far. Update: I reached out to the developer who responded quickly with very helpful advice. I'll be supporting with the paid version. Great app!"
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,good repetition for practicing
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,Good app very simple and straightforward
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,Good learning materials
com.learningfrenchphrases.verbmaster,Nicely designed simple app. Good and helpful content for French grammar. Very worthwhile and good value one off purchase

com.getmimo,Mimo makes coding super fun and easy
com.getmimo,"Está bien, pero el problema está en que va demasiado rápido. Te dan una lección sobre algo y nunca más se vuelve a repasar eso, la app asume que con esa lección ya lo aprendiste para toda la vida y sigue adelante, así con todo"

com.companyname.MaturaMatematyka,good but it could be more fun my daughter is better with math though
com.companyname.MaturaMatematyka,"bagus, lengkap. tapi Jan terlalu serakah dong. masa taro iklan di setiap selesai pelajaran. saya saran kasih di setiap 2-3 pelajaran. dengan itu orang jadi lebih enak belajar nya. saya jadi males pake ini karena ada iklan nya terus. walapun cuman berapa detik. bisa bikin mood ilang"

com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"It is a good app, but there are so many mistakes in it."
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"not bad but tons of spelling errors. for example, it's mission impossible, not mission imposible. Proof reading would be ideal."
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"Too many errors to use this app for learning English. Here are some examples:   ""I need an help with my homework."" (should be: ""I need help with my homework."") ""An used phone."" (should be: ""A used phone."")"
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"I would have given this app five stars if it wasn't for the ridiculous amount of ads. Show me an ad after three exercises/topics or so, not two ads after every single exercise."
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,good app
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,I don't know the reason why this app is not famous that much..but I am learned a lot by this app...thanks to this I am gonna crush and rock in next exam..

com.milinix.englishgrammartest,Good tests!
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,Has some typos other than that it's very good.
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"The material is good, but there are a few statements that need correction to avoid possible confusion or misinformation among learners."
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,The app is really very good . But we can't find exactly what we want.
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,I like the application
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,helpful
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"I have no idea who created this app, but one of the explanations doesn't make any sense. When I answered ""the party was boring,"" the answer key said that the correct answer was ""the party was bore."" The explanation even mentioned ""a bored party."""
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,it's best for child
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"This app has a lot of potential and it is good. However, they are too many instances where either the explanations do not make sense, or answers are marked as mistakes when they should not be (ex: ""You must to come to my party"" is apparently correct). I have little to no complaint for the lessons, they are great, but when it comes to the exercise they are too many instances where I doubt the answers."
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,good app and very helpful
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,It is a very complete app but it has some errors in the answers.
com.milinix.englishgrammartest,"Great app for English language,If you want everything in one place, like confusing words, grammar topics,and each topic of this language then everything is in this app, I have completed all the tests and learning in 5 months. extremely easy to use,well-designed app. Love from India 🇮🇳 keep going god bless you 🌸"

a reservation for me''. And the answer is ''of course not'' 😓 which the 
meaning in the application もちろん、構いません。　it should be ''of course, why not'' 
I think. If you say ""of course not"" it means 絶対できない/絶対そんなことない、isn't it"

com.codeway.aitutor,muito
com.codeway.aitutor,"I saw an ad for this app on Instagram, and it was interesting because it claimed to be completely free. However, after installing it, I realized the ad was misleading and it was only free for 7 days. I hope the developers learn to be honest with people."
com.codeway.aitutor,very good 👍😊
com.vrgs.ielts,great app for IELTS
com.vrgs.ielts,"I don't think it's IELTS, most tasks don't even correspond to actual IELTS questions. Listening module is especially bad. 7 simple questions with predictable pattern, the audio seems to be made with AI or Google translate... that's not how actual IELTS listening is. And then you expect people to pay for the content? Seriously? Two stars because I did enjoy speaking part."
com.vrgs.ielts,Very useful
com.vrgs.ielts,Good
com.vrgs.ielts,Very good.
com.vrgs.ielts,Good one
com.vrgs.ielts,Correct answer nu incorrect show kr rhye A

com.sololearn.ai,worst app they couldnt have the leaves
com.sololearn.ai,"Nice app to learn... practical guidence and lessons in AI TOOLS (n8n,lovable, opensourse LLM) will be useful if added in this course..."
com.sololearn.ai,very beneficial app
com.sololearn.ai,"it's perfect application for Students, programers, an AI generalist for initial stages."
com.sololearn.ai,Advertised is misleading. It isn't free any other information is not necessary I do not suggest anyone download this app and assume that you're going to get something that you really don't have to pay for
com.sololearn.ai,Good
com.sololearn.ai,it only teaches me ai
com.sololearn.ai,Super helpful app to learn the fundamentals of AI and put it into practice
com.sololearn.ai,"Wow, great!!! it's good to use to learn"
com.sololearn.ai,It could better if you add advanced courses.
com.sololearn.ai,"Same app with less features…! What's the usability? I really like the Sololearn app and I've been using it for more than a year! It has great features and community support. This app is just excluding all coding courses and the community. This app doesn't even sync with Sololearn app! I've to create new account with same email here. So, it's useless at least for me."
com.radiocom,Very cool app with no problems and easy to navigate. Please make Audacy app for Google TV streamer too please.
com.radiocom,Love it.
com.radiocom,"My experience with this app has continuously declined. I continue to have difficulties connecting to the stations that I want to hear. Also, I one of my favorite podcasts is no longer available on the app."
com.radiocom,this app is AWFUL. I can't get though a single podcast without it freezing several times and eventually crashing while I have full service. I would not have it if there was any other way to listen to the buffalo bills' one bills live podcast in real time while I'm out of the am stations reach. 1/10 would not recommend.
com.radiocom,"It would be a 5 Star, if we could add a widgets app on our cellphone."
com.radiocom,really unstable
com.radiocom,would skip audio live or it would randomly go back 10 or so seconds. no the best app to listen live radio
com.radiocom,"I'm listening to app as I write this. It's the 5th time I'm listening to same interview. It keeps resetting. Gets 3 minutes past last run then resets. I figure this 25 minute interview will take 2 hours. This happens all the time. This app brags about 24 hour rewind but controls don't work. Try and advance 15 seconds to try and speed up the 3rd listen, reset. I usually just skip past or give up. It's just sad. UPDATE: 1/12/2026. App sucks. It only gets worse."
com.radiocom,"terrible, I have a 5g connection and the app just keeps stopping, over and over, the spinning wheel of death, I have to continually close yhe app, then it takes 3 times for it to reopen and reconnect for maybe another 5min.s, very frustrating"
com.radiocom,got to be the worst audio app I've ever tried. constantly stalls out. constantly stops playing altogether. I've got to restart it constantly. I try their website and it's just as bad. useless crud
com.radiocom,"An absolute garbage app! if you can actually find a game, you either can't listen, or it just shuts itself down every few minutes."
com.radiocom,easy to use. plenty of channels.
com.radiocom,"It's a decent app, it would be a great app if they didn't insert commercials in the middle of a song or while the station I'm listening to is doing a funny skit or touching on a serious matter...If they put the commercials in their proper place it would be a awesome app..."
com.radiocom,"Terrible app, all it needs to do is be able to stream a radio station, something my high school nephew can manage. Feels like the only reason they make it so that the stream constantly freezes is so they can play their commercials constantly before you get to listen to another 30 seconds of a stream before the cycle restarts. Dead silence is preferable to this spp. Find literally any other option. I wish I could do negative stars."
com.radiocom,"I had this app before the new year, and it ran just fine. But now everytime I try to sign in, it just boots me to the original screen, asking me to log in. it works on my iPhone, But not on my main phone, which is my android. plz fix this ASAP bc I liked this app."
com.radiocom,"Broken. This app sucks. It requires a login to work, and when I try to login with email and password it just blinks and shows the login page. Useless."
com.radiocom,as soon as you get it all set up and going just shut off. please remove from the app store!
com.radiocom,"I listen to my favorite talk radio station, and it's very cool that you can choose which time section to listen to. Each segment even has a topic listed. The only thing I can't stand about this app is that the fast fwd & rewind buttons are TERRIBLE. It takes more time to ""push"", then think about doing the action, than it takes to just keep listening through the commercial breaks."
com.radiocom,"Crashes or freezes my Samsung A15 every day. Sometimes 3 times a day, I reloaded the app, cleared my phone cash, rebooted 4 different times - no difference."
com.radiocom,"Broken, can't sign in with email or Google."
com.radiocom,"It's buggy in 2022, still buggy in 2026. App can't handle when the phone switches between the cell network and wifi. It stutters or hangs and usually can't recover without killing the app and restarting."
com.radiocom,"App always has a hard time connecting and staying connected. App is constantly.losing connection. This has to be the most frustrating app I am forced to use, I hate it."
com.radiocom,Audacy is a scam. I hear one song followed by 20 minutes of commercials. Don't waste your time.
com.radiocom,"No matter what time of day or night I try to listen to KDKA radio in Pittsburgh . I keep hearing that Downey Rinse and Refresh commercial. Every 5 minutes . Also the Tide Pods commercial. ""Oh let me make an announcement"" ""Attention customers , if you want a real deal try Tide Pods"" Over and Over for weeks now. What do they have like 4 Sponsors to run the same commercials every few minutes. And it seem like they turn the volume up when these commercials come on"
com.radiocom,This app constantly freezes and closing it doesn't help. It takes a day for me to be able to get it to start playing again without the circle of doom.
com.radiocom,Doesn't always open correctly. Ads are for places hundreds of miles away from me so are not relevant. Ads also play over the local news report.
com.radiocom,Garbage
com.radiocom,garbage. constantly overlay commercials while the program is proceeding. sometimes every 2 to 3 minutes.
com.radiocom,"Terrible app. Like everyone else says, it constantly stops and you have to close and reopen the app only to have it stop again!! Just checked in after having deleted it months ago. App asked a permission I think. I say I think because the app notification is completely blocked from view by Android's Navigation Bar on the bottom of the screen. As a rule, i don't click on notifications I can't see or read. Whomever designed this app needs to fix that for me to reinstall it."
com.radiocom,more time buffering than playing music. doesn't happen with I ❤️ or TuneIn.

ai.artificial.intelligence.genai.generative,"I never gave a 5 star review, so im not sure how it said that. most importantly, I paid for the course and sent email twice now. Why am I seeing a pay screen just to continue the first part of one lesson? Why are you charging my debit card 15 bucks when I never got to use what I already paid for previously? I'm poor, I'm permanently Disabled and on a fixed income so every cent matters to me. Reimburse my payment please if you want to conduct yourself in this way."

com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"Mot a bad app, but it seems to be getting slightly more annoying with each update. I wouldn't mind some of the updates if there was a way to turn them off. For example, you used to be able to press continue after each task to get to the next one. Now, once you've answered a question the app immediately takes you to the next question. I like to re-read/re-listen to answers a few times, but now I'm taken to the next question automatically and have to press Back each time."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,ahead of the other ok
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"so far, it's the best option I've tried."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,fast learning
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"Would rate higher, but almost everytime I open the android I am meet with a dark screen. It doesn't matter how long I wait, the screen stays grey until I close and restart the app. I've initially stopped using Babbel due to this bug over a year ago and the issue still persists to this day."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,Pay wall keeps me from going further than the first couple lessons.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,very professional
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"I travel quite a bit and need to know many languages. Babbel has helped me improve my French, Spanish and Italian. I'm now fluent in French and Spanish and hoping to do the same with Italian. I highly recommend it!"
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"Would be nice if you thaught Portuguese from Portugal, crazy how you have Portuguese from Brasil but not Portugal...."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"I'm enjoying using Babbel. When I skip using it for a few days, it offers a review lesson to help me refresh what I was working on last. All of the lessons are short but complete. You can stop in the middle of a lesson if you need to. The pictures in the lessons really help me to connect the content. I recommend this app."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,so dope
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,Rubbish
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,after the first lesson i had to pay.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,really great for learning a new language also a lot better and cheaper than Duolingo
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,should be 2 week free trial see
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"Excellent learning platform. Starting with simple everyday words, and building short phrases. Enjoy repeating the audio practice phrases. Also enjoy the explanation of the grammar and the explanations of when to use male/female nouns."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,So easy to start from.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,I like the way it repeats to get it in my head.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"This app is awful. Too many Glitches. Daily lessons dont always register. Streak freezes dont renew every Monday. I was able to learn how to read and write a bit of Spanish, but even after dedicating a year to them was no where near speaking it. Way too expensive for what it is. I've been with Duolingo for less than 2 weeks and am already speaking Spanish, and Im still on trial. Duolingo also offers other learning experiences. I have already learned the basics to playing chess and reading music."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"Do Not Waste Your Money. I paid for a year subscription and stuck with it almost every day. 320 plus day streak. I even spent up to 2.5 hours in a day and I still didn't speak Spanish. Even though I almost completed 2 different Spanish course, I didn't realize I was doing Spains Spanish and not Latin Americans Spanish. The app is really buggy too. There was a lot of times that it wouldn't register the day I pratciced. Which you sometimes get 2 streak freezes, tho it says every Monday"
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"Dear Babbel developer, I hope you are well as you read my message. I would appreciate it if you could add Arabic to this application, as I speak Arabic and it is not currently available. Many people would like to learn English through this app."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,Babbel is very good in learning Spanish with.It actually makes the language lively.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,it's great but it's a bit of a bummer that you have to pay to continue learning and doing lessons
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,love it
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"babbel is the best way to learn. it's fast and easy to learn, read, and write in your language in no time at all."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"Text and audio quality are well above average. There is no comparison. This alone explains why the app is more expensive than most others. After three months of daily use, however, I am tired of exercises that require typing on a sterile cellphone screen. A pen-and-paper mode would be valuable, allowing handwritten answers, auto-correction, and a simple touch-based validation. Handwriting has proven to be far more effective for language learning."
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,It is great so far.
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,"app not loading audio or photos, if I can not fix I will be requesting refund"
com.babbel.mobile.android.en,im learning fastt

com.hellotalk.aigrammar,its a bad app....Please don't installed it.
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,best app
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,this app is useless because it charges money to check error
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,useless
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,I had a very bad experience with this app.
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Bug! can't login.
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Very nice!
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"only 3 checks, then must pay a fee. not as good as other app."
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,the app is not working on my keyboard
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,good
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,WASTE OF TIME! DON'T BOTHER. I COULDN'T EVEN GET IT TO TO DISPLAY THE DIRECTIONS BEFORE I UNINSTALLED IT!
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"""hi Ai grammar can only check English"" even though its full english🤦 had to restart the app just to fix it making a 15 unskippable ads show up. Deleted."
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,İt is rubbish they are making app just for begging money
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,AI grammar is not picking
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Very good app 👍
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,It is useful for correct spelling
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"The app colors are blinding and the ui is unusable for me. They need a dark mode. Since I can not see the menus, I can't use this."
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,All English
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"I have no words for the effectiveness of this app. After using this app, my grammatical accuracy became 85%... I'm pretty sure it was well above 95% beforehand, just like: Yes, a woman CAN make a man a millionaire...given that he is a billionaire to start with."
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"3 free grammar check YO team plant potatos men, you gonna do better that seat down there"
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"I wrote something in English, and it says, the app can only correct English."
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Good 👍
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Waste
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Asked for money to continue but I don't have that much money
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,"Based on my experience, this app proved ineffective and useless. A grammar check of a draft email yielded only two suggested word changes, both of which were unnecessary and inaccurate as the word was already what it suggested I change it to 🤷‍♀️ weird"
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,Wow
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,5start for being unuseful app and very easy to uninstall
com.hellotalk.aigrammar,I watch 30 sec ads just to have 1 reward to correct my grammar. Now this apps increase the 30 secs ads to 1 minute ads. No longer data friendly.. that's why I decide to stop using it and explore other grammar corrections apps.
com.datacamp,can't run a code
com.datacamp,very good to learn with
com.datacamp,"please fix the bug... when I want to click on an option suggested while coding, it displays multiple times I love this app"
com.datacamp,awesome
com.datacamp,Good app
com.datacamp,"I really like the courses and learning experience, but occasionally the app has loading issues during study sessions and requires a restart. Improving app stability would make it even better."
com.datacamp,Top data learning platform
com.datacamp,A nice app makes it easy to learn about the desire knowledge.
com.datacamp,"I highly recommend DataCamp for those interested in DataScience, AI or Machine Learning. The platform is so user-friendly, practical and understandable."
com.datacamp,"since this thing can't get refund, I'll give this 0/5 cause the lack of practices, why y'all give practices that the codes already exist there? lack of theory"
com.datacamp,I love your pedagogical approach
com.datacamp,waste of money and time.
com.datacamp,it is the best app to learn any Tech skill related to data
com.datacamp,Good
com.datacamp,"I've been using Data camp for an year now. I've got some discounted offer last year and renewal was also accordingly, that's how I was able to renew it. I like the way the courses have been taught here, the videos are of shorter duration and at the end of each section, assessments make sure that we've done it all. I would say studying here is addictive. 🙂 still I would suggest to add thorough assessments and better subscription plans so more people can benefit from this."
com.datacamp,"Better than traditional lessons, it's excellent with practicing modules"
com.datacamp,Good
com.datacamp,great for learning coding
com.datacamp,"Great platform, still figuring out and will give detailed review in the future."
com.datacamp,"dishonest business practices, it auto renewed my subscription without a way to get a refund without informing me."
com.datacamp,the simple way of understanding hard things get your flowers 🌹
com.datacamp,Data Camp changed my life
com.datacamp,"Haven't even used the app for 5 min, stuck on the same lesson, im doing exactly what it asked for, even check with someone who knows python, won't proceed and says the answer is wrong."
com.datacamp,"The main (desktop) app is very good, but the 'flashcards' feature doesn't work properly in the android app, specifically code examples in the sql flashcards don't format as blocks of code, just a single line, which is virtually unreadable."
com.datacamp,"Sorely disappointed. the lessons are and exercises are incredibly short and brief. no explanation of what's going on and what's worse is I got to an exercise in the Python training and dead ended when my correct answer was labeled incorrect. double and triple checked. no insights given into what was ""incorrect"" so the lesson could not progress. ran out of inspiration after that. 100% would not recommend."
com.datacamp,A very good and educative app.
com.datacamp,"Have some shame , your content is old and your charges are exuberant, you should really think your business decisions."
com.datacamp,sometimes it crash and very slow.
com.datacamp,Great
com.datacamp,"Awesome courses, awesome website, they know how to teach the topics to be understood, interesting, and applicable."

com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Simply superb app for absolute french beginners
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,i hate this app fix please
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Good for listening to fast french speaking and learning new words. However it definitely builds patience as there is so much lag.
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,You have to sign up to use it
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"The app lags a lot, especially when you are listening to the audios. It seems to take forever to respond and then responds at once altogether. It would make a great 5 star app if those issues were to be fixed."
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"Nice idea and all, but as soon as you start a section, it freezes on the screen. I'm sure it's not my phone because if I got out of the app, everything is working just fine."
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"You think you downloaded an app ready to use but when you open it all you have is a page to open an account with your email, that sucks 😞"
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Good
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"Working to slow on my device Redmi 9. But the idea for application is genius. Make the same app for German, please. I will buy subscription if you do."
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,It's pretty good. Though I would like to see the previous sentences thar I've gone through before.
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,i want to try but it seems buggy. After audio clip plays it freezes and i have to close the app. Unusable unfortunately
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Great app for building listening skills
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"I just discovered this app and I really like it. Easy to use, and focuses on listening to authentic French dialogue. So far, a very positive experience."
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Great app so far! Finally something that is not for beginners and expands your vocabulary.
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,"Great concept, but the audio is terrible. It's a hard no for me."
com.listenup.french.listening.practice,Audio quality over voice recordings are poor which hard for a beginner to figure out what was being said even if I did know the words.
com.preply,The worst app I have used in my whole life.
com.preply,amazinggg
com.preply,why preply deleted the support so it's hard to ask something if we have questions. and also why u removed ur whiteboard and chbage it to only canvas that u can only upload a page not a book or file in PDF. it's really make studying presses is harder and not comfort. I just find out that u can access again the customer service if you update the apps. and for whiteboard an canvas hope it will be better. thank you preply
com.preply,beutiful
com.preply,"Preply needs to stop displaying a banner to schedule the next lesson everywhere in the app, including over messages."
com.preply,It's a great app!
com.preply,Very good for learning new language..
com.preply,"I have two subscriptions with two different tutors (A and B). The available time-slots I see for one of them (tutor A) are all either for the slots I already have scheduled with another tutor (tutor B), or after the date my subscription is renewed. If I cancel the lessons with the tutor B, I can no longer see available time-slots for tutor A. If I book then lessons with tutor B, available time-slots ""magically"" appear only for when there is an overlap with tutor A."
com.preply,"Teacher Esraa makes learning efortless.Thanks to her patient and confident teaching style, Looking forward to our next session."
com.preply,"I have been using the App to learn Danish and Korean, I've been loving it and I love how you can talk to an actually human I've given it a 4 instead of a 5 star because I was trying to book an individual lesson but you can't do that. You have to stay with the preset plans that preply has in place It makes it annoying for me as I was wanting to do a lesson this week but I'll have to subscribe again next month"
com.preply,The Worst. I was a tutor on Preply and one day they suddenly deactivated my tutor account with no clear reason. I had about $1000 in my account and I can't withdraw it now. They don't respond to any emails.
com.preply,awful
com.preply,I found the best tutor on this app. This app is affordable and helps alot.
com.preply,makes teaching professional
com.preply,it's not free! need some payment
com.preply,nice
com.preply,drops post before I can finish
com.preply,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! Terrible, invisible policies and procedures. Bait and switch pricing changing rates and rules constantly. Over promises and under delivers; they encourage you to pay for lots of lessons but the tutors are then not available so you lose your money. new bugs every day. costumer service page Unavailable."
com.preply,scam I book a lesson trial for 1 hr just to say if.legit ans paid an hr for very cheap.tutor but as soon as im online she didn't show up late and she said I had to.rebook what? u want to paid again for thr course ans subscribe again? I will not paying again totally rip off i rather go to youtube itmjust make.sense it's free u like this app charging u 40$ an hr that's insane
com.preply,great study platform.
com.preply,"Worst app for tutors, only do it if you're desperate for work but the platform does not care about it's tutors at all."
com.preply,"So far, we love his guitar lessons. We have done 3 already and we just upgraded to the monthly payment."
com.preply,very bad it's keep tutor payment
com.preply,Great
com.preply,"good platform for finding teachers but it lacks transcript of conversation, so you better switch to teams once you found a teacher."
com.preply,Best language learning tool ever. Real tutors for every pocket. I also like that it isn't just about languages but a wide array of subjects too. Love it!
com.preply,"Truly an excellent app, Mr. Ahmed Rashid Canada has helped me improve my English."
com.preply,"The App that just keeps treating you worse, the more you use it. this is my 3rd visit to the review center, and this time I'm feeling deceived. preply offers subscriptions, not lessons. it then never backs down over billing, AND WONT LET YOU UNSUBSCRIBE. DO NOT BE FOOLED by the friendly up front assurances. I've just lost $400 (?) of €1200 ? in lessons over the holidays (local currency), and I'm just tired of the platform taking so much, and bleeding fans. so sad for my wallet & great tutors :("
com.preply,"FRAUDULENT SCAMMERS STAY AWAY!!!!! I saw 35/hr with first lesson free, but couldn't even message the instructor unless I paid 50 dollars first WITH THE ASSURANCE that I wouldn't be charged unless instructors accepted. LIES LIES LIES IT'S A SCAM!!!!"
com.preply,"Preply is a very good platform for online learning. It is easy to use, well organized, and connects students with competent teachers. Scheduling classes is simple, and the overall experience is smooth and professional. I am satisfied and would recommend Preply to anyone who wants to improve their skills online."
org.khankids.android,Amazing for my kids.
org.khankids.android,So easy to use and makes understanding quicker
org.khankids.android,"My child,Alia loves this game 🥰 but sometimes there is no internet and when she wanted to open donate or parent guide,they didn't work properly. Please check what happened and fix it😊"
org.khankids.android,it was so lagguy
org.khankids.android,"If you are looking for a good educational app for your kids, this is the one I use with my 2yr old son. He likes it and it's free with a bunch of stuff. It'll read books to him. has learning songs, and sorting, letter, number games. It also grows with your kid 👍 the only work it needs is you have to be very precise with the drag and drops in the games."
org.khankids.android,"I was looking for something educational to get my 3 year old grandbaby off of Pikmin and Astrobot. After looking through several apps, Khan Academy with its graphics, stories, informative animal and science videos, math games, learning levels, logic,etc..looked very attractive. I downloaded it (free!!) and tentatively introduced it as another game to my grandson. Now, he can't get enough of it! He is always exploring the Library and learning, and showing us his achievements!! THANK YOU so much!!"
org.khankids.android,very good
org.khankids.android,good 👍
org.khankids.android,they love it and I think it is a nice supplement to school.
org.khankids.android,brilliant app.im first time happy with any app .this is the app which is really a fun teacher for kids.
org.khankids.android,poorly developed app. Made for engagement with too many pictures and sound but does not help develop reading or learning skills. will not recommend.
org.khankids.android,wonderful app for kids
org.khankids.android,"We’ve only been using Khan Academy Kids for a short time, but I’m really impressed. I wanted educational screen time that felt worthwhile for my toddler. The app is completely free, has no ads, and includes a great mix of videos and interactive learning. Some repetition, but that works well for kids. Minimal glitches so far. It’s a great complement to preschool for early reading, math, and foundational skills."
org.khankids.android,"I love this app as an ad-free option for allowing interactive, game-like screen time. The content is thoughtfully curated and usually involves building levels of skill in each area. There is alot of repetition, which I appreciate and my child doesn't seem to mind. I like that the visuals are relaxing and the pacing is slower than other generic children's content, even for exciting themes. A few of the instructions aren't 100% clear, but not a big deal. Access to the full library is a big hit!"
org.khankids.android,Great development for my kid!
org.khankids.android,Fantastic interaction with very well targeted learning layouts. Appreciate the purpose!!
org.khankids.android,I have nothing but positive things to say about this app. I work on the lessons with my grandson and he loves it.
org.khankids.android,nice
org.khankids.android,it is good all you need is a cleaner and it should be good.
org.khankids.android,useless app. very slow and doesn't work at all. keep on hanging all the time. was not able to play even one game since download.
org.khankids.android,very good app
org.khankids.android,superb
org.khankids.android,excellent
org.khankids.android,Professional
org.khankids.android,"free, educational, no adds"
org.khankids.android,we love it both my kids (2) & (6) spends 2 hours a day on it 😀
org.khankids.android,It's really helpful to my children highly appreciated 😍😍😍
org.khankids.android,perfekt
org.khankids.android,educational and fun
org.khankids.android,"Can't even login anymore, it's just stuck on loading animation. What a shame we loved this app."
com.busuu.android.enc,this is. verey use full app in spoken English iam today installthis app
com.busuu.android.enc,Good 👍 intresting
com.busuu.android.enc,nice 🙂
com.busuu.android.enc,best app ever
com.busuu.android.enc,One star because recent update added double the adverts.
com.busuu.android.enc,"I JUST WASTED MY PRECIOUS POCKET MONEY ON THE PREMIUM PLUS SUBSCRIPTION BUT IT'S STILL THE SAME ON MY ACCOUNT, I DIDN'T GET THE PREMIUM PLUS BENEFITS. ps: if u cant give me my premium plus I WANT REFUND!! ASAP"
com.busuu.android.enc,Great app! Underrated. Love the connection it gives you to native speakers!
com.busuu.android.enc,"Just paid for premium plus yesterday and I still haven't gotten premium plus , I'm very disappointed"
com.busuu.android.enc,it's fun an it really helps i think whoever gets this app can improve
com.busuu.android.enc,"Won't refund me for the app I don't use. Took it to the bank. Got my money back, but yet, these guys were able to charge my account again. After the bank got me a new debit card. I will not be making anymore purchases through Google. They can reverse your unauthorized transaction made from the bank. Money hungry company."
com.busuu.android.enc,"The constant ads are absurd. The app also doesn't update things like notifications or progress in real time, making you close and re-open the app to get rid of notifications and see check marked progress. As a language learning app, the corrections aspect of communities is good (though idk why formatting on mobile requires codes to line break and such). The actual lessons themselves are strange so far, at least for Japanese. Stop promoting premium so much and ads after every lesson, please."
com.busuu.android.enc,"really helps me to learn chinese, but I'm wondering is the chinese course have the hsk 3.0 (new version) or os it still the old version"
com.busuu.android.enc,"The frazes are actually useful which isn't always the case with language apps. However, the free version has constant adds and the real nail in the coffin for me was that the speaking practice parts say you did well no matter what. I got a little suspicious, so I said ""bangapseumnida"" instead of ""annyeonghaseyo"" and it gave me a perfect score."
com.busuu.android.enc,this is a great learning app
com.busuu.android.enc,Nice Easy way up to professional in French speaking
com.busuu.android.enc,норм
com.busuu.android.enc,very nice
com.busuu.android.enc,Superb Learning app
com.busuu.android.enc,dear nice
com.busuu.android.enc,cool
com.busuu.android.enc,good
com.busuu.android.enc,Crash when I want to get a placement test after sign up. But I can use the app if I choose beginer. Overall the UI/UX of this app is neat and nice.
com.busuu.android.enc,wish there was a search by topic function. for those like me who just go to the country and want to learn then apply immediately functionally.
com.busuu.android.enc,good
com.busuu.android.enc,this is such a good app its wayy better than duolingo try it out
com.busuu.android.enc,good
com.busuu.android.enc,সেরা
com.busuu.android.enc,"I love your app, I learned a lot with it! I'd like if you add Thai language to your app ❤️ pleaseeeeeee"
com.busuu.android.enc,makes you use ai to continue the lesson process 🙎🏻‍♀️ do not support
com.busuu.android.enc,nice 👍 app satisfying learning
world.petr.vokabeln,"The AI Explanation does not work consistently. I am learning Spanish. If I select English as the native language. The AI Explanation works correctly by giving the synonyms in Spanish. However, if I select Italian as the native language, the AI Explanation give the synonyms in Italian. I need the synonyms in Spanish, which is the language I am learning. Edit 1/18/2026: Was this issue fixed in the 1/14/26 update?"
world.petr.vokabeln,The free tier is generously good.
world.petr.vokabeln,"Extremely well designed app. I am happy that I can learn Anki style without the UI looking horrible. Pricing also very fair, and a lovely app experience! Fully recommend"
world.petr.vokabeln,ارجوكم اضيفو اللغة العربية
world.petr.vokabeln,"Very good app, there is room for improvement: 1. Add custom schedule for notifications 2. Fix sound bug, sound is missing after first round of words"
world.petr.vokabeln,Ease of use is smooth. Includes C2 level vocabulary which is rare. Highly recommend.
world.petr.vokabeln,The most comprehensive language learning app.
world.petr.vokabeln,Another ai service trying to sell subscriptions.
world.petr.vokabeln,add mandarin please!! and if you made vocab decks by hsk level and topic this would be fantastic app. currently learning mandarin and spanish would be able to use this for mandarin as well.
world.petr.vokabeln,"This is an excellent app if you are familiar with the language already, this app is not for beginners, since this app is a vocab trainer and not an all around language course, so if you are looking to expand your vocab, I really recommend this app!"
world.petr.vokabeln,"Amazing!! add Arabic, Russian, vietnamese amazing app."
world.petr.vokabeln,This is great!
world.petr.vokabeln,An effective method without games / without distraction. Lean Design.
world.petr.vokabeln,"I really like this style of learning. It's a very easy to use application. Very usable even on the free tier. The app uses AI extensively, but I don't think this is a bad use of it."
world.petr.vokabeln,"I hoped for the option to add my own flashcards to utilise the spaced repetition system. There's no Chinese which I'm interested in, but I will use it to improve my German and maybe Spanish. Not very optimised for multilingual use :c"
world.petr.vokabeln,"please, add another language for instruction there's no english-english or english-indonesia"
world.petr.vokabeln,"Adding new words is not a super smooth experience, but I really like this app. It's helping me a lot."
world.petr.vokabeln,"This app is honestly remarkable. Exactly what I needed to expand my french vocabulary and I find I am actually remembering the words it trains me. I also love that you can add your own words very simply (and that it's obvious which are your own and which are theirs), and I find the chat bot so incredibly useful - allows you to do various exercises at your own pace and the bot corrects the mistakes you make by explaining why what you said was incorrect (i.e. like a real teacher!)."
world.petr.vokabeln,"Edit: Developer solved a technical issue very quickly. App functions well and better than most others I've tried. Original: This app is an active scam. Do not buy it! App is fully featured in the free trial. However, when purchase premium, you find half the features are still locked behind a yearly subscription. To be clear, this is a 40 EUR one time payment, followed by a 50 euro yearly subscription, and users are deliberately misled into believing it's a one time payment."
world.petr.vokabeln,"While I choose i am a b2 or even c1 user, the app makes me start practicing words that are too easy unless I individually mark them as known, one by one. Bad start and I don't feel like exploring it more..."
world.petr.vokabeln,Good developer. responding fast. showing care about his app and customers
world.petr.vokabeln,"Awful software generated audio. The app asks for one of those trials you have to remember to cancel before you have actually used the app in any meaningful way. The Swedish beginner's cards had a major mistake within the first 10 or so. The app is just trying to teach you words in a vacuum, without mentioning singular/plural forms, verb tenses and the like. This is yet another AI-driven, a-dime-a-dozen apps trying to capitalise on automated translations and generic content, so don't bother."
world.petr.vokabeln,A true Hidden Gem beats all the flashcard apps for me ❤️❤️
world.petr.vokabeln,Very convenient and great app. Hope they will add also Goethe C1 words to the collection
world.petr.vokabeln,There are not many languages to learn (e. g. russian is missing)
world.petr.vokabeln,Bad
world.petr.vokabeln,It's an awesome app!
world.petr.vokabeln,"Definitely has a potential, but atm I'm finding it really annoying how it keeps resetting my progress if the internet is lacking. Doing cards in an Uber while it's going through a tunnel? Chances are, you'll have to redo them again, keeping track in your head what you remembered the last time and what you missed. Surely it shouldn't be that difficult to add some offline functionality and sync things later when possible. Once that's fixed, I'll happily change my review"
world.petr.vokabeln,amazing app. no ads and a more than enough free plan. what more can a person ask for
world.petr.vokabeln,"Seems great, but is there a possibility of adding more languages? The ones I'm currently studying (japanese, korean and estonian) are not there."

com.hello.japanese,I did like the app in a short time after i start to use Very useful contents it has I do reccomend to everyone who is newbie in learning Japanese and struggling with reading the janaese letters slowly
com.hello.japanese,can we get an option to review flashcards without daily limit?
com.hello.japanese,"Suscripción is too expensive ,would be okay if all language is included."
com.hello.japanese,"only 4 free stories. seems like a good app, £60 a year"
com.hello.japanese,"Having articles appropriately separated by difficulty level is nice, and the options for what you do or don't want to see, like the English translation line by line, is quite nice. the UI is reasonably user friendly. Minus two stars for AI generated art. It makes it feel cheap."
com.hello.japanese,"I really like this app, but I’m having some difficulties when it comes to learning vocabulary. I want to learn phrases, not just individual words, but the app doesn’t allow me to choose phrases to study. Please review the translation tool, as it often produces incorrect translations— in some cases, it fails to translate at all and skips entire sentences. Because of these translation issues, I need to copy the full sentence to use an external translation tool,but the app doesn’t allow me to copy"
com.hello.japanese,The app has a nice variety of texts accompanied by contextualized dictionary entries. The UI is clear and the overall feel is wonderful. This might be the first time I'm enjoying reading in japanese instead of plain struggling with every sentence.
com.hello.japanese,Absolutely perfect but I wished it had more free texts
com.hello.japanese,Exactly what I've been wanting
com.hello.japanese,It's a slick app but the 'easy' stories are still very hard
com.hello.japanese,"Wants you to sign up for a trial for 7 days, for its yearly subscription before even showing you anything worth subscribing for... this application put the cart so far ahead of the horse that the horse started asking for driving lessons. I'm not comitting to a free trial I might forget to cancel, for an entire year no less, for an app that doesn't have anything to show for itself before ramming a subscription in my face. I have 5 similar apps all of them 1000% better."
com.hello.japanese,Great
com.hello.japanese,"Thanks for addressing my concerns, happy to upgrade my review to four stars. My only other suggestion would be a way of reporting faulty flash cards. Sometimes they are left blank, or the audio does not match the pronunciation guide and I can't see an easy way to flag these for review at the moment."
com.hello.japanese,"Can't move on unless you actually subscribe, even though there are articles labelled as ""free"". No point downloading unless you wanna pay!"
com.hello.japanese,One of the best apps to improve japanese reading
com.hello.japanese,It made me perfect
com.hello.japanese,"It's saying that ""no internet connection detected"" or keeps loading for ages when I'm connected to the internet with good connection. I wanted to buy a premium version, but it's not working... so disappointed."
com.nht.toeic,thanks for all

com.nht.toeic,I am really satisfy with this app.

com.funeasylearn.french6000,"Forces you to sign up for a 7 day trial and then be charged $50 if you don't cancel, without even letting you see any of the course. Makes you answer a bunch of questions as if it is starting the course and then forces the 7 day trial. Asking Google to remove app from store and ban developer. Grade = F. Uninstalled."

Now it looks like it was made with generative AI, like all those 3D mental health advertisements. Really worried that this art style will get added to the other languages. I've been avoiding updating the other languages since this horrible art style update on the French one."

com.ereflect.wordela,"Great app, except it keeps asking to sign in after being unused for a while, if Google is used as the sign-up method. Hope it gets fixed soon 👍"
com.ereflect.wordela,"Just started, love it."
com.ereflect.wordela,Wordela is the best vocabulary and spelling development program from all the other programs that I have used in the past years.
com.ereflect.wordela,One of the best vocabulary building apps that I've seen. Very comprehensive and gratifying
com.ereflect.wordela,really good app so far I haven't bought the premium version yet but one complaint I do have is that I can't toggle off my dictionary function. When reading the basic summary of the word. I also suggest that we be able to edit the summary or word definition to our liking.
com.ereflect.wordela,I'm using it and everything works fine. only when I want to practice spelling I have to turn off the app after every session because the next one will not load
com.ereflect.wordela,This is a really good app i really like it
com.ereflect.wordela,This app would be oh so perfect if it wasn't so buggy. I hope to see changes very soon.
com.ereflect.wordela,"Sign up with Google exists, but doesn't work. Tried three times - nothing happens after( The Learn vocab feature doesn't work: ""User doesn't have access to wordlist"". I created this list to study, who else has access to it if not me?!"
com.ereflect.wordela,Good one
com.ereflect.wordela,Glitch bad Ui not recommended
com.ereflect.wordela,I can't sign in with google login with my phone. Sign in blinking and not redirect only visible login window. How to fix that?
com.ereflect.wordela,Vocabulary with definition is very useful for the beginners.
com.ereflect.wordela,Very nice vocabulary builder. Well done!
com.ereflect.wordela,Unable to login to my existing premium account (which uses google login) :(

com.Hello_Hello_Japanese,Size too small for a tablet and no custom setting
com.Hello_Hello_Japanese,"I was looking forward to this, I want to learn Japanese and this was making out it was perfect, but they didn't mention that only ONE lesson is free and that one is nota good one because you have to download ONLY the audio! The prices are £1.99 each or £14.99 for them all. To me that's a rip ofv . All in all it doesn't deserve even ONE star but I have to give it a star, it is such a zero"
com.Hello_Hello_Japanese,"One lesson free and you have to buy the others $1.99 each or $14.99 the whole pack.  UI not really adapted to tablets, or let's say not very comfortable. One exercise had weird characters instead of Japanese. Also it says you don't need to be connected, there are additional downloads for the audio content."
com.Hello_Hello_Japanese,"Surprisingly good program. Great look, good material and each lesson gives you enough to make it worth the price. UPDT: Latest ver, app2sd works!"

com.duolingo,it was very good but I don't have super Duolingo or max Duolingo so when my energy ran out I recharged with my gems and not even after one question all my energy ran out that is a serious scam I had earned those gems with 18 days of hardwork . . . .
com.duolingo,whatever you decide don't pay for the max version of this. they can't be bother to fix the problems on super so I guess that the max version more than likely won't work correctly either

com.chatexpo,it is a great app and u can choose which topic u wanna talk about. Love it!!
com.chatexpo,cool
com.chatexpo,"ok,so this app MAKES ME read Korean as a beginner and a first day! so I don't hate it just pls upgrade it for the person who did it and I just want to say the app is ok but it's not for me. others like it more and good job😊👍💕"
com.chatexpo,"I selected the beginner options and the first exercise it recommended was to read Japanese and respond to sentences. I got the app 'cause I don't know the language and it was expecting me to respond with words and phrases that the app didn't teach me. Also, include whether or not the app costs money upfront. Just because I invested the time of answering a few questions doesn't make me feel more obligated to spend money."
com.chatexpo,too buggy. didn't even get through the setup phase. needs work
com.chatexpo,Highly recommended
com.chatexpo,I think it's a fun
com.chatexpo,"I see one of the best set if features comparing to other similar apps. The problem is they all just don't work. You should not have brought such a crude product to the market imho. As for me, I'm not ready to pay for it."
com.chatexpo,не могу использовать свой микрофон не смотря на то что предоставил все разрешения
com.chatexpo,There was a bit or confusion with this app (I got charged a subscription but I didn't want it) easily got it sorted out and refund with their customer support. I might not want to use the app itself but their customer service is 10/10 good stuff. Highly recommend and. Thanks Ju!
com.chatexpo,its so helpful fun and i have learnt korean but it has strated to distrub first when i was using itt did not ask for money now it is asking for money and i used to chat for free what is going on ??
com.chatexpo,"Great app, need constant human improvement though. For the synonyms section suggestions are provided for the mother tongue, not for the target learning language. This is usually not very useful, I need suggestions on how to say that differently in the target language."
com.chatexpo,I don't like this boo
com.chatexpo,good
com.chatexpo,"the language that I want to learn isn't here, hope u add Thai in the future"
com.chatexpo,its the best 😁
com.chatexpo,The evaluation never loads. Stuck. sad.
com.chatexpo,nice
com.chatexpo,needs improvements
com.chatexpo,So happy to have found an AI application that supports Indonesian. It has all the features I want.
com.chatexpo,I don't know about this app but giving u 5 Stars
com.chatexpo,It's so good and useful for me. Thanks a lot..
com.chatexpo,For Japanese even if you say you are new and know nothing it expects you to know how to respond to sentences and read Japanese without teaching you anything first... am I missing something?..
com.chatexpo,its great
com.chatexpo,"I couldn't even register, a bunch of bugs..."
com.chatexpo,didn't work
com.chatexpo,"this app seems very good, actually, but you can't expect me to know all the kanji for the japanese course when even the locals have to look some of them up. Sadly the Japanese course is not possible like this, too bad! (there's over 50.000 kanji signs)"
com.chatexpo,nice app
com.chatexpo,the latest update has broken the app. Useless.
com.chatexpo,"Disappointed because when I first came on to download this app, it wasn't stated that I needed to pay anything. So I haven't used it yet"

club.speakpal,its good app for learning english
club.speakpal,"I have been using the SpeakPal application for over 2.5 years, and it has played a significant role in improving my English communication skills. Initially, I was provided with free premium membership, which added great value to my learning experience. However, this premium access was later withdrawn. Recently, I have observed that some users are again being offered premium membership, while I am not eligible for it. This has been a bit disappointing for me as a long-term and loyal user."
club.speakpal,after new update my Bluetooth earphone stop working for this app. It work on other app. Please fix this bug.

livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,"I hope the developers see this. The audio feature is not working on mine. I have tried re-installing but it's still same. I also use the English counterpart which works perfectly, but this French version is not giving me audio. I'd appreciate any guidance, please. I'm looking forward to a solution, SVP. Thank you. Otherwise, je t'aime bien l'application. C'est utile !"

livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,Great !
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,I feel downloading all language when you supposed to have them already on the so the only thing left will just to update is data consuming. it supposed to be as you download the app it has all the languages downloaded with it not that I'll download English then waste my data to download french because there's a french word the the English version is reading out wrongly.
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,This application is very helpful.
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,"simple à utiliser et très pratique, je le recommande pas plutôt je l'oblige à tous."
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,"Excellent, use all the time. I like the etymologies & the IPA pronunciations are especially useful as you can see alternatives to the Audio pronunciation (top left speaker symbol). Good Search, History, Notes. Did you know you can do wild card searches? Use ? symbol for the missing letters when playing SUTOM."
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,excellent 👌
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,I can't update something stupid.
livio.pack.lang.fr_FR,Meilleure application pour s'enrichir en vocabulaire... Gratitude aux co-créateurs d'application....

com.languagedrops.drops.learn.learning.speak.language.french.words,"I have a love-hate relationship with Drops. Loved Drops when I first downloaded it a few years ago. Uninstalled it when it got repetitive. Downloaded it again a few months ago. New features were added, and it was great. Tonight, as I was doing the Drops French app, I got a pop-up to download the main app which I did, & now both Drops apps keep freezing. Since I can no longer use either Drops app, I'll uninstall, stick to the apps that function properly, & maybe try Drops again at a later date."

I have a hard time making habits, so having an 86-day streak is ever-so-slightly earth-shattering. It's also nice to just have the one language to focus on. If you have attention issues, this app is a good option."
com.languagedrops.drops.learn.learning.speak.language.french.words,such a great app!
com.languagedrops.drops.learn.learning.speak.language.french.words,"All versions of Drops, have the same poor programming, extreme bad design, and they all discriminate against millions of customers, they all cause personal injuries, eye strain, headaches, physical pain even from using it under the 5 minutes trial. If they did a few simple updates, and allowed android settings to be used then a few would work, but sadly after a year this company still doesn't care about customers or its own products causing harm."
com.languagedrops.drops.learn.learning.speak.language.french.words,"The new energy meter sucks. I get it they need more new premium subscribers but the system that was before was good, you are limited in your settings but you could atleast get new terms easily, now with the new energy meter i just feel the app is trying to force me into buying premium."

com.lulilanguages.j5a,"Not super great in comparison to other kana learning apps. Please consider teaching with context rather than just saying what they are. ""I opened the door with a き"" for example. It would also help learners to understand why stroke order matters when writing. I also know that we all must pay the bills, but this app's paywall happens way too soon. Other apps/programs only lock kanji behind a paywall rather than hira/kata. Overall, not pleased."

com.lulilanguages.j5a,"The first two lessons are great. There are a few issues, though. The i characters are missing the small よ. For example, the lesson will show ひ and really mean ひょ which can be confusing. Also, I paid for the app, and I cannot use any of the other lessons past 2. I will start lesson 3 get through the first question and the screen will turn blank. I see this is a common issue and hope it is resolved soon. If these issues are fixed, I think I'd give it 5 stars.

This glitch not only does not provide the right answer, but STOPS the Lesson from continuing. I've sent an email to the developer, no response. I'll push on looking for more bugs and update here.

Imagine my dismay when I attempted to start and I was placed in a March cohort. I emailed support and was told I could begin sooner but when I asked to change they wouldn't. Access is a scam!! Why would I buy a self paced online class to have to wait 60 days to begin? Nonsensical. Completely misleading the consumer.

It doesn't track my process at all and I have to constantly revisit the same parts of my courses without being able to actually fully complete, because whenever I leave the app and open it later the 'pick up where you left' button brings me to a section I've completed days ago, it even takes me through the already done and completed quiz only for taking me back AGAIN the next day. It's annoying really"
org.edx.mobile,I love EdX. Started using it in 2013 to take a math class I needed in order to finish my MBA and been taking classes from time to time since.
org.edx.mobile,Working in a library means we are constantly helping others find reliable information. edX has helped me sharpen my own research and data management skills through their professional certificate programs. I love that I can 'audit' courses for free to gain knowledge or choose the verified track to add international credentials to my resume. It’s an empowering tool for library staff in the Pacific.
org.edx.mobile,"love this app, I used it to upgrade my skills, it's a user friendly app and so many courses to choose from."
org.edx.mobile,thanks is all I can say....
org.edx.mobile,good
org.edx.mobile,not alot of free options
org.edx.mobile,"The edX app is an excellent platform for learning anytime, anywhere. It offers high-quality courses from top universities and institutions around the world. The app ia, well-organized, and makes it easy to track progress, watch videos, and complete assignments on the go. A great choice for anyone who wants to upgrade their skills or learn something new at their own pace."
org.edx.mobile,can't apply coupon on app
org.edx.mobile,app doesn't gives the certificates even if they're free
org.edx.mobile,"I've already been to about 4 different online courses and EdX is definitely the best, easy to understand, highly informative and interactive. EdX is a MiT side project, their reputation is extremely awesome! 👍"
org.edx.mobile,Garbage. Shoves down a chat bot on your face and wastes your screen. There is no option to hide or drag it which makes reading anything just a chore. Utter and total garbage.
org.edx.mobile,perfect app
org.edx.mobile,"unable to login. always keeps on saying that i don't have an account when i try to continue with google. And when I try to register myself as a new user, it says I'm already registered. I am stuck in this never ending loop. I have also tried forgot password method but nothing happens (a password reset link is never received). Extremely disappointed!"
org.edx.mobile,Apps need some improvement. contents are top notch
org.edx.mobile,Excellent
org.edx.mobile,"The content itself is high quality, but the mobile app now functions largely as a catalogue. Most courses redirect to web pages and paid enrolment, with limited genuinely free, in-app learning. It feels more like a library or storefront than a learning app. Disappointing compared to how usable edX used to be on mobile."
org.edx.mobile,Its a great app and I love it.it deserves 5 star!
org.edx.mobile,excellent app forever.
org.edx.mobile,Best learning app
org.edx.mobile,It is the best app I have ever seen for a student
org.edx.mobile,good for Afghan girls
com.languagedrops.drops.international,excellent
com.languagedrops.drops.international,this is perfect for everybody! to talk to people who don't understand the language we speak! it might be very hard to learn a language but for me? ITS really working for my Spanish test (finals) PLEASE make this the best top no.1 app language learner!
com.languagedrops.drops.international,very helpful
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"Now the app is using up my rescues in spite of me doing my daily lesson at about the same time every day. The app is losing it's shine. I had to downgrade my rating to 3 stars After using the app for more than a year I have to say the app leaves out a lot of words and phrases that could make daily life in Portugal much easier. Teaching words and phrases rarely used. Also the rescues, day and time seem to be random without any reference as to how to manage, day and time for where I live."
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"reviewing after one lesson, very good so far"
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"Though this app isn't specifically for learning long sentences or grammar, it is a lot of fun and helps you learn smaller words and phrases to get started. This is a great app to use for a couple minutes a day and expand your knowledge on a language without it being frustrating and taking forever. The app can be a bit buggy/slow but there aren't many ads to fight through."
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"Never get reminder notifications. Such a bummer... This never was an issue before. So I basically forget to use this app every day, since it's not a habit for me to yet."
com.languagedrops.drops.international,it's a very good app to start with
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"Terrible update. Makes you want to give up after 5 years of daily endeavour. Had reached out for support from the site and after two months, still no answer. There further updates still haven't addressed issues Such as slow load of lessons. Regular extended pauses. Changing the translation for 30-50% of the words, with no lessons. Some are clearly incorrect. Some are synonyms so that is fine however after 5 years, have they been teaching accurately? Downgrading my Lifetime subscription to Annu"
com.languagedrops.drops.international,its very fun to learn vocabulary like this
com.languagedrops.drops.international,Bought the [Premium Lifetime] version a few years ago; signing back in recently 'activated' my Premium account... which is now yearly. Bait and switch BS.
com.languagedrops.drops.international,very interesting
com.languagedrops.drops.international,needs a free option otherwise why would I use this when duo lingo exists?
com.languagedrops.drops.international,outstanding application software. I really like it most. thanks to the creators.
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"very good and understandable, I recommend it for new learners"
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"It is an amazing app. I would give it five stars if you correct the way you are writing the ""alif"" in Arabic language. It is written ""ا"" but, it is supposed to be ""أ"". There is a huge difference between them. Please correct it."
com.languagedrops.drops.international,love thoa app. but a couple of months ago something corrupted and not all the words written match the sound and image. maori language
com.languagedrops.drops.international,Ai art for an educational app is an odd choice. the app itself is good but I prefer the human made art before instead of whatever slop you had a machine cook up when you guys were obviously capable of making art for the app yourselves.
com.languagedrops.drops.international,enjoyed it so much
com.languagedrops.drops.international,this is absolute the best app to learn languages so far
com.languagedrops.drops.international,blocking the android status bar. please fix
com.languagedrops.drops.international,very Good learning aap
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"new update looks terrible, it's completely thrown off my plans for lessons, and I feel like I completely wasted the annual purchase I made less than two weeks ago"
com.languagedrops.drops.international,Excellent method to learn new words (I've tried many) enjoying so far thankyou
com.languagedrops.drops.international,bien application
com.languagedrops.drops.international,I'm learning Te Reo Māori. The audio often does not match the text on screen. Either the audio is wrong or the text is wrong. The Quiz Mode feature is not applicable for this language. Would be great if this was addressed.
com.languagedrops.drops.international,it's amazing. very helpful for learn languages
com.languagedrops.drops.international,"I subscribed to the lifetime 4 years ago. I've spent the last 6 months regularly trying to get it to connect, and it won't. I have the same phone and same account but it will not restore my purchase. as of now customer service has been non existant. I've put in multiple messages asking for help, entered my email (just did it again for probably the 10th time) and have not gotten a response or my account restored. I really liked this app but here we are"
com.languagedrops.drops.international,👍
com.languagedrops.drops.international,charges for a year instead of a month after trial. no way to change that after the fact.
ielts.vocabulary.builder,"after installation, this app shows only ads. it isn't helpful to see that this app has any features. Worst"
ielts.vocabulary.builder,"Amazing app, excellent !"
ielts.vocabulary.builder,It's poor for none understanding English language speaker due to can't translate any other language or don't select any text for translation.
ielts.vocabulary.builder,I ourches this app and still showing add and one thing I didn't get it why it's purchased is not showing on Google purchases side. it's pro version I purchased it Ty I can download it

ielts.vocabulary.builder,very supportfull english application ..
ielts.vocabulary.builder,Thanks a lot 👍
ielts.vocabulary.builder,Good app
ielts.vocabulary.builder,You need to add Hausa language as well. That's the most widely spoken language in Nigeria.
ielts.vocabulary.builder,"Very good app which help you learn a lot of vocabulary also new sentences. However,it can assist you in your practical life.So,you can install and use the app without tension."
ielts.vocabulary.builder,"It,s a amizing app and so helpfull. It,s need some ususer,s friendly change.but over all 5★."

ielts.vocabulary.builder,this app is very helpful in improving my english. i really enjoy to using this app.
ielts.vocabulary.builder,"And its said pro, lol big fake!"
ielts.vocabulary.builder,Good
com.aomiapp.aomi,"Effective for tone and flow. Users must master the writing system, it's not built for beginners. It's not an free app, but has some samples."
com.aomiapp.aomi,it looks interesting but I don't want to make an account without even being able to try it first
com.aomiapp.aomi,Really improved my accent lol really worth it if you're thinking on going to Japan and talking to natives as pitch accent can be confusing
com.aomiapp.aomi,"This app is pure bunk! Try not speaking a quiet room and see what score that app gives you on your pitch! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I wanted to see if this spectrograph recording actually works. I recorded myself not speaking in a quiet room. I was not talking at all, and in the playback no language could be heard. I still routinely received 90-97 % pitch perfect on the words I 'attempted'. I'm not even sure we can trust the native speaker recordings."
com.aomiapp.aomi,"I'm a native Japanese speaker and found the pitch scoring unreliable. While the system often gives robotic speech low score, it appears it rewards only a specific style of fluency and accent precision. When I carefully follow the style, scores reach 80–90%, but varied speech often drops to 60–80%, and occasionally 0%. Unnatural, mimicked ""foreigner"" pronunciation can score 90%, though usually around 70%. I don't believe aiming for high scores in this app leads to native-sounding Japanese."
com.aomiapp.aomi,"So far it's great for what I need it for. But you have to use it with clear expectations. Relying on the % to teach insights past its capability will not help. A dev request, please create a section for minimal pair testing, like at kotu.io. This will greatly help beginners like me who have an extraordinarily hard time recognizing any changes in pitch for a single word, let alone a sentence. I've bought a lifetime pass for this and am excited to see this app evolve!"
com.aomiapp.aomi,Excellent 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👍👌👌👌👍👌👍👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👍👌👍👍👌👌
com.aomiapp.aomi,Unusable. Keeps crashing on my infinix phone
com.aomiapp.aomi,"This is my favorite Japanese learning app as a heritage speaker who has trouble with speaking in general. I like that it actually gets me to practice speaking out loud when my tendency is to just practice in my head (bad habit and shyness lol). I do wish there were more tracking/progress markers for the vocabulary side. But overall, I am satisfied with my purchase."
com.aomiapp.aomi,"Omg...this app is amazing. I downloaded it for my Japanese pronunciation, it's really useful guys..!!!"
com.aomiapp.aomi,Most things are for premium users only otherwise it was a useful app
com.aomiapp.aomi,everything but one word per category is locked behind a pay wall.
com.aomiapp.aomi,nice
com.aomiapp.aomi,Good app but still lots of features are showing to be comming soon without any deadline.
com.aomiapp.aomi,This is a well made app for people who already have some knowledge of Japanese pitch accent and want to work on perfecting it. Just what I was looking for
com.aomiapp.aomi,Everything locked behind a subscription and the lessons don't seem to be in a logical order.
com.aomiapp.aomi,Aplikasi ini sangat bagus :) saya tidak tahu bagaimana cara mendeskripsikannya!
com.aomiapp.aomi,Loving it so far! I'm an N3 passer but struggles with speaking the languagr. I hope this app will really help me improve my weakness.
com.aomiapp.aomi,Super Aussprachetraining für die japanische Sprache
com.aomiapp.aomi,"The pitch accent analysis doesn't work very well. I tried saying things completely wrong (understand, the opposite of what was required) and still never scored less than 80%. Having said that, the vocab seems useful and the recordings are good and you can still practice pronunciation even if the analysis doesn't work. So I might keep the year-long subscription. Edit: The analysis simply doesn't work. Among my 80+%-scoring attempts were some where I said the phrase in a totally flat pitch."
com.aomiapp.aomi,"I have no idea why the ratings are lower on this app, maybe it went through some growing pains druing launch, but it's pretty great right now. The pitch accent training is extremely important, and this app does it's job very well. You can playback your voice, listen to native speakers, and see what accuracy your pitch is in a clear and concise way. The phrases provided are practical as well. It's a clean app, and it has a clean interface. I'm N4 level, and it's extremely helpful to me."
com.aomiapp.aomi,"This app is a scam. I used the free 7 day trial then paid for a subscription. Once the 7 day trial finished and they took my money, the app stopped working. It won't go passed the initial screen. I've tried updating the app and contacting them, and nothing is being done to correct the problem. Save your money and don't get this app. Update: was given a 1 year subscription promo code but it didn't work and I was still going to be billed. When I contacted them regarding this, they ignored me."
com.aomiapp.aomi,(Updating my review) I purchased the lifetime access of the app and now I can say that is perfect with no issues! The intonation check really helps you understand how you pronounce the phrases compared to the correct pronunciation. It also includes real Japanese phrases that you don't want to miss. Thank you for your reply and for the development of this app. It's really good!
com.aomiapp.aomi,The app is really good and you can get a years paid subscription for what others cost a month.
com.aomiapp.aomi,Great app to learn Japanese!
com.aomiapp.aomi,I like the idea but the volume of the audio is very low.
com.aomiapp.aomi,"This is the first app I've discovered that enables you to practice speaking and test your ability to use pitch accent correctly. So happy that it has been created! My main concern is around the training, it seems to dive straight away into specific words and long sentences, a steady ramp up from basic would be useful. It would also be good if there were a feature to test cards added to one's personal deck, I can't see a feature to do that, meaning testing your ability is tricky."
com.aomiapp.aomi,"Seems like it would be good for people moving to Tokyo, but if you speak Kansai-ben, this app is useless. I speak Osaka-ben, and according to this app, some things I pronounce are 'wrong', but in reality it's just my accent. It would be like telling a foreigner from Birmingham that they are pronouncing English words wrong because they don't sound like a foreigner. Ask someone from Tokyo how to pronounce「犬」, then ask someone from Tokyo. Both answers are right, but the tone shift is opposite."
com.aomiapp.aomi,Registration doesn't work
com.aomiapp.aomi,"I feel like the course over complicated a lot after just looking at the free material, and the perspective the developers are writing from feels very strange. The voice tool is ok, but I feel like it's the kind of thing that will just drive you crazy trying to get it perfect just to still be wrong in the end...."
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"There are a lot of language learning options through this service and they all use the method popularized by ChinesePod from the early-2000s. It's a great method. Some of the banter between teachers is kind of cringe but otherwise the lessons are pretty good. I've used this for Cantonese, Japanese and Italian. The app needs to be updated. Lots of old UI elements and no way to favorite lessons or add them to a custom list."
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,Gorgeous! 😍😍
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,the app is great. l find it best to learn any language's you would like to learn
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,This is nice app
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,good
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,Very well done
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,it's an amazing app it helps me learn Japanese every day it's amazing I love learning Japanese because of this app
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"A lot of functionalities are missing from the app. After a 4 days usage, I see no advantage using that app over heading to the Hungarian pod 101 website and using the web app instead, except the very useful lesson downloads. I think it would be great to have all the flashcard stuff in the app. Nevertheless, the app works well, I did not yet encounter any bug. A functionality to play all reviews in a playlist would be great."
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,can I take certificate from it
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,fantastic learning tools
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,Tusen takk!

com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,continue the best free service
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,This app is wow. It deserves 5 starts
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"having used dualingo, this one is not so good. Starter lessons are fast and not fun at all. app is boring and needs some interaction. all in all, it's not great and it is expensive. also always pushing premium in your face all the time is annoying."
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"Great language learning app at any level. The most basic level alone is worth the money. The way they teach is very effective, moreso than other apps I have used. I highly recommend it!"
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"good teaching method for a second foreign language but if your goal is english, then the app is pretty poor. also i miss many functionalities from the website in the app like flashcards and the the thematic word lists also poor interactive layer - why not to give us an option to practice the sentences under Word of the day (fx first read the sentence then write it yourself) it's very passive learning and one learns only through active learning"
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,French #101 app
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,I love it! Finally a worthy app to learn new languages
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,it is very helpful for every learner who wants to speak english
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"it's one of the best and most hassle free way to learn Japanese, even stronger and faster if paired with immersion method."
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,It is perfectly amazing 👏
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"It's been quite a while since I last looked at HP101. It now looks to be a heck of a lot better than it once was. I'm suitably impressed and, based upon what I've seen so far, I would highly recommend it. (Using it on both cellphone and desktop.)"
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,you say it's free but it isn't.
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,"it has been invaluable for my learning, considering that I am always on the go. they are real lessons with no gimmicks so I appreciate that."
com.innovativelanguage.innovativelanguage101,Very nice app to learn Greek

sk.baka.aedict3,"Using this dictionary for 10+ years on different phones, it's my go-to and I enjoy all the options it includes. It doesn't get better than this, really. More intuitive than Jisho to me. I'm thankful for this app."
sk.baka.aedict3,great app word reference
sk.baka.aedict3,"it's a great app that I've been using for years. the only downside is on the quizz with text-to-speech, when speaking there's a pop-up that hide the skip/next button and we have to wait until the pop-up to disappear to be able to go to the next card. this is fairly annoying and is making it loose an unnecessary huge amount of time ( x hundreds of cards) can the devs do something about that?"
sk.baka.aedict3,"Been using it for years, still my favourite Japanese dictionary."
sk.baka.aedict3,"Please allow use without Tatoeba installed. I basically only want JMdict from this; I don't care for Tatoeba's examples. It's just a waste of 200MB on my phone. Really nice that you can update dictionaries to the latest version. That's a feature sorely missing from all the other J-E dictionary apps I've tried, and with how often JMdict gets updated and improved upon it's a big plus in my eyes."
sk.baka.aedict3,When I upgraded to pro it deleted my notepad data. Years of useful data gone because I tried to find a way to transfer my data to my new phone by buying a subscription. I like the product but user data is sacred. C'mon man
sk.baka.aedict3,I used more than 10 years
sk.baka.aedict3,"This otherwise excellent app has a very irritating flaw built in, apparently on purpose. Even when getting the stroke order right, the kanji you draw are often not recognised. The workaround used to be a paid-for extension, which I paid for but which is no longer available or recognised. To get better kanji recognition, you have to get a subscription, which, for the occasional learner, is not worth the price. Compare that to the Pleco Chinese app, which has flawless kanji recognition."
sk.baka.aedict3,Excellent tool
sk.baka.aedict3,"Last update broke it. Stuck on update dictionarys page. Deleting and reinstalling dictionaries, deleying data and cache did NOT fix the problem."
sk.baka.aedict3,"Better than the alternative but not very good. Downloading the dictionaries is a real pain, taking more than an hour on wifi. Visually the screen is too crowded. The quality of the dictionaries is not very good, esp. for beginners since they include too many rare or unusual readings Latest version is an absolute disaster: although dictionaries are up-to-date, no way to get out of the download manager"
sk.baka.aedict3,"Перестало запускаться Upd: Very quick response and fix, thank you very much."
sk.baka.aedict3,Very good dictionary app.
sk.baka.aedict3,Crash on startup still happening even on the latest version 3.51.6. The application is unusable. It's a shame since it used to be my favorite dictionary.
sk.baka.aedict3,Can't use the app anymore. Was forced to reinstall which made me lose all my data which I culminated over years. Now the crashing upon startup issue still persists. I love using this app but I'm clueless how to anymore. I hope the devs see this and will find a fix. Using a Samsung Galaxy S22 ultra
sk.baka.aedict3,"I'm not sure what's happened with this latest update, but the app is essentially unusable. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app because it wouldn't open, now that it opens the kanji search won't work and just brings up the result of my previous search. Edit: update to fix this issue has forced me to uninstall and reinstall again. The kanji search issue is fixed, but all of this has caused me to lose word lists I've had for over five years."
sk.baka.aedict3,"Thanks for quickly fixing the crash issue, this app is awesome."
sk.baka.aedict3,"Excellent Japanese dictionary app, has a quirky interface but way more features than most similar apps. Developer is very responsive. Worth subscribing to."
sk.baka.aedict3,Fixed and workimg again
sk.baka.aedict3,Edit: fixed in new update :) Crashes on launch with the latest update :(
sk.baka.aedict3,"Love this app. Very easy to use to lookup specific kanji based on shape, radical, drawing."
sk.baka.aedict3,Suddenly the app refuses to open. Is there a bug?
sk.baka.aedict3,"Stopped working, won't open—a bug? Time to try out other dictionaries."
sk.baka.aedict3,Stopped working after latest update. Won't even open. Pixel 7. Had to delete cache & memory and redownload dictionaries. Otherwise pretty good.
sk.baka.aedict3,Update broke the app. Crashes and blank screens. High battery use warnings.
sk.baka.aedict3,Have used it for over 10 years but now it crashes every time it tries to download the dictionary files so I cannot use the app.
sk.baka.aedict3,I think the only downside is that you need to know the correct stroke order for drawing the kanji
sk.baka.aedict3,hbbbbbç
sk.baka.aedict3,"Excellent Japanese-English dictionary app. Offline and fast, which is what sets it apart from other similar apps. I use this every day. Option to set custom font is excellent if you want to see kanji in Kyokasho style (Klee One from Google Fonts is great for this)."
sk.baka.aedict3,"Five stars for the features, but i can't seem to change the font size. I need significantly larger text. Don't tell me to change my phone's system font size; i wish to change only this app. Please add font size adjustment - - onegai."

com.reallifeglobal.app,"hello I don't have any other way to reach you out so I do it here. it's about my payment that I ve already honored. And you still send me message asking to do it.

lifegoal.learners.aiwithpython,Amazing app ever
lifegoal.learners.aiwithpython,"This app is genuinely incredible. It offers both quick and in-depth run-downs of processes that would otherwise be inaccessable to new programmers. Best used as a reference guide, once read through, and best paired with a robust and traditional ""lesson oriented""-app. This is a critical tool for your future."
lifegoal.learners.aiwithpython,I give all star for this apo i love it. Thans coder of this app
lifegoal.learners.aiwithpython,"Best app possible to be documented on AI in playstore so far. Missing features: Dark mode and some sort of reading tracker. Everytime you close the app and re-open it, it gets u back to the beginning"

com.aofl.abcmouse,i love it!
com.aofl.abcmouse,"Our family is enjoying the app and has been helping our child in many ways. We upgraded to the premium level on our Android phone through Amazon. When trying to have our child use the app on their fire tablet or their Verizon tablet the upgrade isn't transfered to app. We cleared cache, restored purchase, uninstalled app and reinstalled and followed all prompts with our primary parent information. The app still isnt transferred. Any and help is greatly appreciated."
com.aofl.abcmouse,nostalgic my mom used to buy this app so i could spell books correctly
com.aofl.abcmouse,Its a nice app My son like this one better than classic I don't like it because they still haven't added a parent section to see progress and time spent. I would think that they could just copy the code from old and apply to new 🤷
com.aofl.abcmouse,good I also begged my sister to download it
com.aofl.abcmouse,ABC mouse is not fun at all minecraft and roblox and sprunki is so much better

com.aofl.abcmouse,I'm trying to use it with my 1-year-old brother
com.aofl.abcmouse,bad network
com.aofl.abcmouse,"thought I was signing up for the free trial. Got asked for my credit card for billing after the trial, no issues there. then asked if I wanted to pay for the year... I assumed it would be after the free trial. Nope! No free trial. Now I have this til 2027 and I dont even like it. Learning was way below my kids age level, and if you want it higher you have to pay more."
com.aofl.abcmouse,"we loved this for homeschooling, used it from prek to 2 grade. she learned so many different things"

com.aofl.abcmouse,peek-a-boo I love u
com.aofl.abcmouse,great
com.aofl.abcmouse,I thought this app would teach my child how to understand Spanish not English. I changed the language to Español and still recieve only English. What about spanish speaking families who want who practice spanish.
com.aofl.abcmouse,all I get are 3 shapes rotating doesn't stop
com.aofl.abcmouse,"This app is filled with flashy lights and sounds to just steal a child's attention. It also includes games with no educational purpose, as well as a ticketing system that encourages spending for new ""pets"" after every lesson. It feels as though they're trying to just give kids a dopamine hit. I was looking forward to it so I tried it for a couple of days, but ultimately I don't think it's for us."

com.lilata.french,that's amazing
com.lilata.french,"really helpful app, thanks a lot🫶"
com.lilata.french,I've asked for a refund. Like others leaving a 1 star review - you progress to a point & can't continue. Glitchy & slow after about 10 minutes. Nice concept & I enjoyed it but this is essentially a SCAM. Their support email doesn't exist or is too full & my email bounced. Not happy. 😞👎🏼
com.lilata.french,Really fun way to learn and practice French. It has you speak and listen as well. I love the quirky sense of humor the app uses to teach. I actually want to participate.
com.lilata.french,good app
com.lilata.french,so interesting
com.lilata.french,"The lessons are good, but that's not the problem. My problem is that I cancelled my free trial before it was over so that I wouldn't be charged, but I was still charged $75.23 on the day that it would have been over. I now have a year of Lilata that I did not want, after I've tried to contact their support team 3 times. The only contact information they have on their website is an email address that gets sent back after 24 hours. I have no way of getting my money back."
com.lilata.french,Thank you so much for the refund. Now I understand. I will keep reviewing what I have studied waiting for you new study topics. They were spot on. The app learning pace was right for me and as I wanted it exactly. I found it way better than all other known apps. keep up the excellent work. Thank you Lilata team and good luck.
com.lilata.french,Am enjoying the studies and l hope one day l will speak it better . So am encouraging everyone to learn some.
com.lilata.french,"it stopped working all of the sudden, it doesn't allow you to advance. It's a complete fraud. It has been like this for more than 3 months already they contacted me to tell me that they are working on it, but more than 3 months c'mon!!! hopefully nobody else pays for this and read our comments. What did you resolve? You are giving unlimited access to an app that hasn't been working for more than 3 or 4 months, people who buy this subscription want to learn and keep advancing, c'mon!"
com.lilata.french,very easy to navigate through lessons and learn step by step.. thank you lilata
com.lilata.french,"I really love the app , it's helpful indeed"
com.lilata.french,nice one and good learn language.
com.lilata.french,This is very useful and helpful. l like very much this aap🫰🫰🫰🫰
com.lilata.french,Easiest learning tool I've tried. You should too!! 🙂
com.lilata.french,so peakness!! 🥹✌️
com.lilata.french,Awesome app
com.lilata.french,it's good but i start it recently and can't say about that surly
com.lilata.french,Amazing app
com.lilata.french,I really like this app. Found it very reliable than many other AI dependent app. It also teaches phrases used day to day . But recently the app is preventing me from moving to the next level. It is asking me to complete all the other lessons to move on. I dont really understand this because I did complete every other lessons already. Please tell me a solution. Further I would like the developers to add a tab in the app where we could see all the grammars which appeared in the lessons.
com.lilata.french,French learning is magnificent
com.lilata.french,love this. Much better than Duolingo
com.lilata.french,I don't really like this because they were telling a lot of things but no result 😕
com.lilata.french,I think is good because it can correct one's mistakes.
com.lilata.french,very user-friendly.
com.lilata.french,"It was a nice app in the beginning, but turned out to be a FRAUD in the end. After paying for premium, I was using this app for several days. Suddenly, it doesn't let me start new lessons, stating that I should finish all previous lessons first. But all the previous lessons were already finished! I contacted support. Unfortunately, they didn't fix it, and they didn't give me a refund. Very sad"
com.lilata.french,I really admire it😀
com.lilata.french,"Paid for a 1 year subscription and installed this app about 2 weeks ago. Before the end of section 2 it stopped letting me advance to the next lesson. It keeps telling me I have to complete the previous lessons (which I've done) before advancing. Apparently this has been a problem since 2024. I contacted the app repo and was told they are working on resolving the problem, but that was a week ago. I would advise waiting to see if the app is repaired before subscribing. Too bad, I was enjoying it"
com.lilata.french,Going well .
